# Welcome

!!! info

    All the documentation found herein, will be for **ArchLinux** since that's the distro I use. Some will be general **Linux** ones. Also any documentation found here will be mostly modified to work for me and my hardware. Please do keep that in mind when going through this site.

Welcome to **DarkXero's Bytes** ! This is where I will be posting my thoughts, feelings and some documentation for myself so I do not have to keep looking for them. All the opinions, thoughts and feelings are my own. If I find something useful worth sharing publicly, I will be posting it on the [**XeroLinux**](https://xerolinux.xyz){:target="_blank"} main site.

Documenting my learning journey has become an essential part of my **Linux** experience. It's a powerful way to make life less stressful. Instead of wracking my brain trying to recall a solution from memory or scouring forums and wikis repeatedly for the same answers, I believe that a well-documented note can save time, reduce frustration, and make troubleshooting a far less daunting task. It becomes a reliable companion, ready to guide me whenever a familiar issue arises or a new challenge demands attention.
