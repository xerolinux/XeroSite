**In Memoriam**

It is with a heavy heart that I share the passing of **GamerKing**, a remarkable 19-year-old from my region who lived only 20 minutes away. He was not only a brilliant **Linux** enthusiast but also a vibrant soul who played a significant role in shaping the future of **XeroLinux**. His relentless pursuit of perfection and attention to detail, particularly when it came to consistency, pushed the project to heights it would never have reached without his insightful input.

I will admit, there were times when I disagreed with his ideas, but his persistence, backed by reason and logic, often changed my mind. **XeroLinux** carries his imprint, and his contributions will forever be woven into its fabric. In a place like **Lebanon**, where **Linux** is a rarity, he stood out as a true gem, his knowledge far surpassing that of most people in our country.

For over a year, our country has been engulfed in a conflict, one that escalated into tragic proportions in the last few weeks. It began as a high-tech war, with explosive devices disguised as everyday objects like pagers and walkie-talkies. The violence claimed many lives, and **GamerKing** was caught in the crossfire.

Two weeks ago, his neighborhood was hit for the first time, and he suffered severe injuries, losing a significant amount of blood. From his hospital bed, he reached out to me, recounting the terrifying events. The details of his condition were harrowing, but he maintained his characteristic humor, and we joked about the situation, as we often did. It was a brief, bittersweet exchange, and when we said our goodbyes, I was reassured that he would recover. I had no idea it would be the last time we spoke.

As the conflict worsened, bombings crept closer to both of us. I assumed he was resting and chose not to disturb him, unaware of the devastation that was to follow.

Yesterday, as I write this, a massive bombing destroyed a six-building complex near **GamerKing**'s location. Soon after, I received a message from his younger brother. At first, I believed it was **GamerKing** himself, and my immediate question was, "**Are you OK?**" But the reply came from his brother, who, after a moment of silence, shared the heartbreaking news: "**He told me that if anything happened to me, open Discord and tell Dark**." I asked, trembling, "**Why? What happened?**" After what felt like an eternity, he delivered the words that shattered my world: "**He just left us**."

I still donâ€™t know what took him from us, whether it was his injuries or the bombingâ€”but the tragic truth remains: I have lost a dear friend, a colleague, and one of the brightest individuals I have ever had the privilege to know. The shock of his passing has yet to settle in, and I fear it never truly will.

I will always remember his infectious energy, his humor, and his brilliance. He was the light of **XeroLinux**, and his absence will be deeply felt. Please join me in mourning the loss of a truly exceptional man. **Rest in peace, little brother**.
