!!! warning

    This guide has been updated linking to maintainer's Github, since he has since deleted the scripts. I will try to keep this up to date, checking up on progress.

### What's This?

This for my own use. Use it if you want to. Just documenting the installation of [**Affinity Apps**](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/){:target="_blank"} on **Linux** thanks to [**Twig6943**](https://github.com/Twig6943){:target="_blank"}.

### Installation

First we will need to download the [**Photo**](https://store.serif.com/update/windows/photo/2/){:target="_blank"}, [**Designer**](https://store.serif.com/update/windows/designer/2/){:target="_blank"} or [**Publisher**](https://store.serif.com/update/windows/publisher/2/){:target="_blank"} `exe` from the dropdown. Once we have it/them, follow the guide over on maintainer's [**Github**](https://github.com/Twig6943/AffinityOnLinux/blob/main/Guides/Affinity-Guide.md){:target="_blank"}

### Wrap up

That's it. Once all done we can launch them from the shortcuts the scripts create. That's the closest to **Photoshop** I have ever gotten, without having to go through *WinBlows* if ya know what I mean. Guide wasn't posted on main site due to the nature of the products included. Also this was, as I said earlier primarily written for myself so I do not have to go digging for it on the web. For archival purposes sorta.
