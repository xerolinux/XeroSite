Since getting myself a nice Christmas gift, the [**Ryzen 9 5950X**](https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/desktops/ryzen/5000-series/amd-ryzen-9-5950x.html){:target="_blank"} CPU, I would love to pair it with a nice GPU, I still currently use my now aging GTX1080 (8gb) from 2015 which doesn't allow me to play the more modern games.

</div>

With your help I can upgrade to something more modern. Not looking for latest just a **7800XT** or **RTX3080**. I do not game much, but when I do, I would love it if I wasn't limited by my GPU. I also need it for content creation & my upcoming A.I (Automation) workflow. It has now become a necessity rather than a luxury.

Thank you for your continuous support. Without you none of this would have been possible. **XeroLinux** owes its existence to you. Let's get 2025 on the road shall we ?
