!!! info

    This project has moved to the [**XeroLinux Wiki**](https://wiki.xerolinux.xyz/cosmic/){:target="_blank"}. Will keep this page around for updates. Keep in mind it's in **Alpha**.

### Script info

Well, it does what title says, it installs **Cosmic** in one of 3 ways, similar to how my [**Plasma Install**](https://xerolinux.xyz/news/xerolinux-plasma/){:target="_blank"} script does.

- **Complete**     : Installs Cosmic from Extra Repos.
- **Selective**    : Select pkgs you want yourselves.
- **Development**  : Commit-based Install -DANGER-.

</p>

Included are some useful packages, like a freaking web browser eg. **Firefox**, an archive manager, **Meld** and so much more. It's a start. We shall add more if you wish, just keep in mind that only packages coming from the official **Arch Repositories** are supported, none from the **AUR**.

### Wrapping up

**Cosmic** is shaping up to be the DE that *might* break the current *Top 2* (KDE and Gnome) making it the *Top 3* DEs of all time. Who knows ? I wish the **System76** team all the best.

Cheers !
