      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to &lt;strong&gt;DarkXero&amp;rsquo;s Bytes&lt;/strong&gt; ! This is where I will be posting my thoughts, feelings and some documentation for myself so I do not have to keep looking for them. All the opinions, thoughts and feelings are my own. If I find something useful worth sharing publicly, I will be posting it on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://xerolinux.xyz&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; main site.&lt;/p&gt;

    Hello everyone,
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I need to share some of my thoughts and frustrations. If this isn&amp;rsquo;t your cup of tea, feel free to check out other posts. For those sticking around, thank you for lending an ear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing this post wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy; it took a lot of reflection and courage to open up about these feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S: This blog post reflects the thoughts and feelings of a passionate developer navigating the challenging world of FOSS and the struggle for financial stability. Your support and feedback are always appreciated. Now, let’s dive in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
      &lt;iframe allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen&#34; loading=&#34;eager&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/BpmAFwZy0Gg?autoplay=0&amp;amp;controls=1&amp;amp;end=0&amp;amp;loop=0&amp;amp;mute=0&amp;amp;start=0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    My Frustration
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I’ve been investing a lot of time and effort into my projects and contributing to &lt;strong&gt;FOSS&lt;/strong&gt; (Free and Open Source Software) wherever possible. While I find this work rewarding, it’s also been increasingly frustrating. Why? Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spend countless hours working behind the scenes to make everyone’s life easier. While there are a few of you who go above and beyond to support my work, and I am incredibly grateful for that, it’s disheartening to see so little engagement overall. Feedback is crucial for improvement, and without issue reports or suggestions, it&amp;rsquo;s challenging to know if I’m making a real impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;seeking-purpose&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#seeking-purpose&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Seeking Purpose
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, I embarked on this journey for fun and to learn new things. However, lately, I’ve been questioning the purpose behind my efforts. It feels like I’m stuck in a cycle of constant work with little to show for it. This isn’t about blaming anyone; it’s about seeking the motivation to keep going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;monetization-attempts&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#monetization-attempts&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Monetization Attempts
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As my financial situation became more strained, I reluctantly turned to monetization. Many advised me to turn my passion into a viable source of income. So, I tried implementing a &amp;ldquo;pay what you can&amp;rdquo; model, hoping it would help sustain my work. However, this didn’t go as planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;FOSS&lt;/strong&gt; community, known for its spirit of freedom, often struggles with the concept of financial support for free software. It’s a complex issue, and while some have been supportive, overall, the response hasn’t been enough to make a significant difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;health-concerns&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#health-concerns&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Health Concerns
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of these challenges, I have been dealing with significant health issues. Most notably, I have severe dental problems that require a full set of dentures. This isn’t cheap, and without stable income, it’s been impossible to address. These health issues have affected my confidence and my ability to engage publicly, adding another layer of difficulty to my situation. Health must come before everything else, including fun and passion projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stress from these financial and health challenges has also taken a toll on my mental health. I&amp;rsquo;ve been experiencing frequent anxiety and panic attacks, and the constant pressure has led to a deep sense of depression. The overwhelming silence and lack of engagement have exacerbated these feelings, making it even harder to stay motivated and productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-way-forward&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-way-forward&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    The Way Forward
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given these circumstances, I’m focusing more on forums and this blog. Writing provides a creative outlet that isn’t constrained by algorithms or view counts. I’ll continue to work on my current projects, primarily for my own needs. I will freely share what I can, not everything. I am currently spending more than the income am getting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main priority now is finding ways to support my financial needs. If and when I achieve that stability, I plan to return to my passion projects with renewed energy and many new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;closing-thoughts&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#closing-thoughts&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Closing Thoughts
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to those of you who continue to support my work. Your appreciation means the world to me and keeps me going even when things get tough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, I need to prioritize my well-being and financial stability. Once those are in place, I’ll be back with future projects. Right now, I’m dealing with depression, anxiety, and panic attacks due to my job situation and need time to recover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for understanding and supporting me through this journey.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Developing Is Fun</title>
      <link>/posts/developing-is-fun/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 15 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>info@techxero.com (DarkXero)</author>
      <guid>/posts/developing-is-fun/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;am-i-a-developer-&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#am-i-a-developer-&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Am I a Developer ?
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lol, yeah, I know—it&amp;rsquo;s a question I get a lot. But in my humble opinion, no, I am not. Far from it. I&amp;rsquo;m just a guy who, at most, messes with code—specifically &lt;strong&gt;Bash&lt;/strong&gt;. I take what I understand, put it together in a way that makes sense (to me at least), and hope it works. That&amp;rsquo;s all I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
      &lt;iframe allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen&#34; loading=&#34;eager&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/8_K-NOu-STs?autoplay=0&amp;amp;controls=1&amp;amp;end=0&amp;amp;loop=0&amp;amp;mute=0&amp;amp;start=0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if it does work, I&amp;rsquo;m happy and share the result with the &lt;strong&gt;FOSS&lt;/strong&gt; community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;its-fun-until&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#its-fun-until&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    It&amp;rsquo;s fun until&amp;hellip;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing this is super fun and fulfilling—until I hit a brick wall, stop getting new ideas, or can&amp;rsquo;t find a solution to what I&amp;rsquo;m trying to accomplish. Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s super frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I know I can reach out to the &lt;strong&gt;FOSS&lt;/strong&gt; community for help. However, not all of it is sunshine and roses. I try, but I often get more frustrated with the differences of opinion out there. No matter how much I try to satisfy some requests, I can&amp;rsquo;t do it for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I run into some elitists who think their opinion is the only one that matters. I always make the mistake of replying to them when it&amp;rsquo;s better to ignore them. Yes, those types of people exist everywhere—not just in &lt;strong&gt;FOSS&lt;/strong&gt;. But alas, that&amp;rsquo;s where we feel it the most, especially when we try to monetize our work. But I already discussed that in another post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, once a project is complete, the feeling of accomplishment is so rewarding, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sharing-is-caring&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#sharing-is-caring&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Sharing is caring
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the part where I say: please, don&amp;rsquo;t keep your work to yourself. Share it with the community—who knows, maybe you&amp;rsquo;ll find someone who can help take your project to another level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to keep stuff to myself until I began sharing. That&amp;rsquo;s when everything took off, and I was able to help others. If it&amp;rsquo;s not a project, maybe it&amp;rsquo;s the knowledge you&amp;rsquo;ve gained. Share it by helping others when and where you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sharing is caring,&amp;rdquo; as the saying goes. Anyway, I hope this post was a good read. Enjoy! ;)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;in-memoriam&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#in-memoriam&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    In Memoriam
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is with a heavy heart that I share the passing of &lt;strong&gt;GamerKing&lt;/strong&gt;, a remarkable 19-year-old from my region who lived only 20 minutes away. He was not only a brilliant &lt;strong&gt;Linux&lt;/strong&gt; enthusiast but also a vibrant soul who played a significant role in shaping the future of &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt;. His relentless pursuit of perfection and attention to detail, particularly when it came to consistency, pushed the project to heights it would never have reached without his insightful input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/37Ew8GN.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;gk&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will admit, there were times when I disagreed with his ideas, but his persistence, backed by reason and logic, often changed my mind. &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt; carries his imprint, and his contributions will forever be woven into its fabric. In a place like &lt;strong&gt;Lebanon&lt;/strong&gt;, where &lt;strong&gt;Linux&lt;/strong&gt; is a rarity, he stood out as a true gem, his knowledge far surpassing that of most people in our country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For over a year, our country has been engulfed in a conflict, one that escalated into tragic proportions in the last few weeks. It began as a high-tech war, with explosive devices disguised as everyday objects like pagers and walkie-talkies. The violence claimed many lives, and &lt;strong&gt;GamerKing&lt;/strong&gt; was caught in the crossfire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, as of the writing of this post, his neighborhood was hit for the first time, and he suffered severe injuries, losing a significant amount of blood. From his hospital bed, he reached out to me, recounting the terrifying events. The details of his condition were harrowing, but he maintained his characteristic humor, and we joked about the situation, as we often did. It was a brief, bittersweet exchange, and when we said our goodbyes, I was reassured that he would recover. I had no idea it would be the last time we spoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the conflict worsened, bombings crept closer to both of us. I assumed he was resting and chose not to disturb him, unaware of the devastation that was to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-loss&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-loss&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    The Loss
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, as I write this, a massive bombing destroyed a six-building complex near &lt;strong&gt;GamerKing&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rsquo;s location. Soon after, I received a message from his younger brother. At first, I believed it was &lt;strong&gt;GamerKing&lt;/strong&gt; himself, and my immediate question was, &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Are you OK?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; But the reply came from his brother, who, after a moment of silence, shared the heartbreaking news: &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;He told me that if anything happened to me, open Discord and tell Dark&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;rdquo; I asked, trembling, &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Why? What happened?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; After what felt like an eternity, he delivered the words that shattered my world: &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;He just left us&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still don’t know what took him from us, whether it was his injuries or the bombing—but the tragic truth remains: I have lost a dear friend, a colleague, and one of the brightest individuals I have ever had the privilege to know. The shock of his passing has yet to settle in, and I fear it never truly will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will always remember his infectious energy, his humor, and his brilliance. He was the light of &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt;, and his absence will be deeply felt. Please join me in mourning the loss of a truly exceptional man. &lt;strong&gt;Rest in peace, little brother&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    What&amp;rsquo;s This?
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, after reflecting on my activities and our collective behavior as Linux users, I realized a few things I wanted to share. This post doesn&amp;rsquo;t belong on the main site but here, where I can speak candidly about how things have been and how we, as so-called Linux users, often behave. I&amp;rsquo;m as guilty as anyone else, so let&amp;rsquo;s sit back, relax, grab a cup of coffee or a bottle of beer, and read on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;content-creators&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#content-creators&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Content Creators
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before diving in, I want to clarify that I am not a content creator. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried many times and failed miserably, so I don&amp;rsquo;t include myself in this group for now. However, I need to address the challenges they face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube content creators (CCs) do a thankless job. It&amp;rsquo;s incredibly hard work, requiring meticulous planning, high-quality equipment, and, above all, an enormous amount of patience. Unfortunately, the comment sections are often filled with toxic trash talk, which can be demoralizing. Reading these negative comments can lead to feelings of depression and inadequacy, making creators feel they are not meeting viewer expectations. This is far from the truth; the reality is that satisfying everyone is impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content creators invest significant time, money, and energy into producing videos that inform, entertain, and educate. Their efforts are crucial for enhancing our understanding and enjoyment of various topics. Even writers like myself sometimes rely on their videos to illustrate points or tools we discuss in our posts. Blog posts and YouTube videos complement each other, making our content more engaging and informative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;writers--blog-posters&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#writers--blog-posters&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Writers / Blog Posters
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where I include myself. We do our best to bring you high-quality content. We strive to be as unbiased as possible, but mistakes happen. We are human and sometimes say the wrong things out of frustration, but that&amp;rsquo;s no excuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One common mistake we make is not doing enough research before posting. This can lead to a lack of primary sources to back up our claims, which makes our posts less trustworthy. Recently, it was brought to my attention that I was guilty of this. Instead of pushing away constructive criticism, I embraced it and made sure to do better. Thanks to a user on Discord, I’ve learned to improve, and I thank them for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;appreciating-ccs-and-writers&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#appreciating-ccs-and-writers&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Appreciating CCs and Writers
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often overlook the effort and dedication that content creators and writers put into their work. From brainstorming ideas to scripting, filming, editing, and publishing, every step requires significant effort and attention to detail. They often juggle these tasks alongside their personal and professional lives, making their commitment even more commendable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both content creators and writers face the challenge of staying updated with the latest trends, technologies, and viewer preferences. This constant evolution demands flexibility and a willingness to learn and adapt. Despite these challenges, many persist, driven by their passion and dedication to their craft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As writers and bloggers, we pour our hearts into our work, aiming to provide valuable insights and information. We strive to deliver accurate and engaging content, but we are not infallible. Constructive feedback helps us grow and improve, enabling us to produce better content for our readers. It&amp;rsquo;s essential to recognize that writing is an iterative process. Each piece we publish is a step toward improvement. Constructive criticism, when offered kindly and thoughtfully, is a valuable tool that helps us refine our skills and enhance the quality of our work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fostering-a-positive-community&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#fostering-a-positive-community&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Fostering a Positive Community
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The F.O.S.S. Linux community thrives on collaboration and mutual support. By fostering a positive and inclusive environment, we can attract more people and encourage contributions. Let&amp;rsquo;s move away from harsh judgments and toward constructive dialogues that promote growth and understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we encounter content we don&amp;rsquo;t agree with, let&amp;rsquo;s engage in respectful discussions. Share your perspectives, offer suggestions, and be open to different viewpoints. This approach enriches our community and helps content creators and writers deliver better content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of judging writers and content creators harshly, provide constructive criticism and exchange ideas to help us improve and bring you more useful content. Many of us, myself included, have been guilty of negativity. This message serves as a reminder to be more supportive. Let&amp;rsquo;s help each other grow in the F.O.S.S. Linux community and attract more people by discussing and recommending content thoughtfully.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#conclusion&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Conclusion
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading. I wanted to share my thoughts and recommendations in hopes of making the Linux community a more positive and welcoming place, free from negativity and elitism. By supporting each other and fostering a culture of constructive feedback, we can help each other grow and create a more vibrant and inclusive F.O.S.S. community.&lt;/p&gt;
