&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://distrowatch.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DistroWatch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is basically your go-to website if you&amp;rsquo;re into &lt;strong&gt;Linux&lt;/strong&gt; or other open-source Unix-like operating systems. It‚Äôs been around since 2001 and keeps a huge, up-to-date database of hundreds of Linux distributions plus some BSDs and other niche OSes. You can check out detailed info, compare them, see their release histories, read user reviews, and snag official download links all in one place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They also have weekly news updates and summary articles to keep you in the loop with the latest happenings in the Linux world. Plus, there‚Äôs a friendly community vibe with forums and guides for beginners and pros alike. Overall, it‚Äôs like a one-stop shop for exploring and staying ahead in the open-source OS game.&lt;/p&gt;

    The Good, The Bad &amp;amp; The Ugly
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with the &lt;strong&gt;Good&lt;/strong&gt;‚ÄîDistroWatch is basically the reason a lot of distros get noticed at all. Without it, many would just be stuck in obscurity with hardly anyone hearing about them. For example, I credit some of the buzz around &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt; to this site. Plus, I like how they keep track of each distro‚Äôs release history so users can easily follow along with updates and changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the &lt;strong&gt;Bad&lt;/strong&gt;‚Äîthere‚Äôs a downside. The site isn‚Äôt really well-moderated. That means anyone can post whatever, true or not, and it just stays there. The admins don‚Äôt seem to verify or control what‚Äôs being said about distros. So you end up with stuff floating around that might be misleading or flat out wrong. Not cool, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, the &lt;strong&gt;Ugly&lt;/strong&gt;‚Äîwhich is the main reason I‚Äôm venting here. &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt; has been listed on DistroWatch since 2022 and was gradually gaining traction. Then, when I had to step away due to burnout, they marked it as &lt;strong&gt;Discontinued&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;em&gt;No longer is, check update below&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, I was like, fine, no big deal. But the distro‚Äôs been back in action nearly a year now, and despite my repeated &lt;strong&gt;emails&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Mastodon&lt;/strong&gt; messages, and even supporting them on &lt;strong&gt;Patreon&lt;/strong&gt; asking to update the status, nothing‚Äôs changed. Total radio silence. At this point, I‚Äôm convinced it‚Äôs all managed by some kind of &lt;strong&gt;A.I&lt;/strong&gt; that doesn‚Äôt care about the hard work behind projects. It‚Äôs super frustrating and disrespectful. I rely on that exposure, yet they just ignore me. What kind of site does that? A bad one.&lt;/p&gt;

    Situation Update
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this post originally went up, the situation&amp;rsquo;s been sorted out. &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt; is back up and running, the links are fixed, and things are slowly getting back on track. Big shoutout to that one awesome person from the &lt;strong&gt;DistroWatch&lt;/strong&gt; team who made this possible (I won&amp;rsquo;t name names, but you know who you are‚Äîthank you!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to leave this post up because, honestly, some parts are still relevant. Other distro maintainers have shared similar experiences with me, both recently and in the past. Just wanted to keep you all in the loop about what&amp;rsquo;s happened since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to help us climb the &lt;em&gt;popularity ladder&lt;/em&gt; quicker or maybe even write a quick review, you can do that &lt;a href=&#34;https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=xero&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;right here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But just a heads up, don‚Äôt treat &lt;strong&gt;DistroWatch&lt;/strong&gt; as the ultimate measure of popularity. That site mainly sorts distros by downloads and page views, not by actual user numbers. Plus, nobody really knows if the reviewers actually use the distro for any meaningful amount of time before leaving a review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And hey, always take the info about any distro (not just ours) with a pinch of salt. Some of it‚Äôs spot on, some&amp;hellip; not so much. The only real way to know is to try it out yourself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know what you think of all this in the comments, I‚Äôd really love to hear your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>XeroLinux Explained</title>
      <link>/posts/xerolinux-explained/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#introduction&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Introduction
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months, I‚Äôve been getting asked the same questions again and again: What exactly is &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt;? And why is it locked behind a &lt;em&gt;donation wall&lt;/em&gt;? So, I figured it‚Äôs about time to clear things up once and for all with this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grab a seat and let‚Äôs dive in‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;xerolinux-goal&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#xerolinux-goal&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    XeroLinux Goal
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt; is an &lt;em&gt;Arch-based&lt;/em&gt; Linux distro I built mainly for myself, to make installing Arch easier using &lt;a href=&#34;https://calamares.io&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calamares&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And the desktop environment? Well, it‚Äôs gotta be &lt;a href=&#34;https://kde.org&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KDE Plasma&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, obviously. At first, I went a bit overboard and packed in way too much bloat, kinda like &lt;em&gt;Garuda&lt;/em&gt;, which honestly wasn‚Äôt great. Here‚Äôs a video from the very first release so you can see just how rough it was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
      &lt;iframe allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen&#34; loading=&#34;eager&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/l8Z7fr79A8I?autoplay=0&amp;amp;controls=1&amp;amp;end=0&amp;amp;loop=0&amp;amp;mute=0&amp;amp;start=0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But over time, I kept trimming things down and optimizing until I had a solid base to build on. I didn‚Äôt want every possible piece of software included by default, just the key settings and system tweaks, the stuff that takes the longest to set up. By settings, I mean system optimizations and some &lt;em&gt;ricing&lt;/em&gt;. Why? Because my needs change all the time, and packing everything in would just blow up the ISO size too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWhat about drivers?‚Äù you might ask. Same deal. My hardware changes now and then, so including every driver under the sun wouldn‚Äôt make sense. Instead, I stick to the basics (&lt;em&gt;kernel drivers&lt;/em&gt;) up front, with options to add more as you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I started sharing the ISO with my close friends, they loved how stable, easy to install, and lightweight it was, so they pushed me to turn it into a proper distro available to everyone. I was hesitant at first, since that meant I‚Äôd be responsible for support, but eventually, I took the plunge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;benefits--features&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#benefits--features&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Benefits &amp;amp; Features
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike many distros packed with tons of features and apps, &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on a smooth, easy installation and helping you learn &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.archlinux.org&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arch Linux&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; through the toolkit we provide. Check out the video below for a look:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
      &lt;iframe allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen&#34; loading=&#34;eager&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/YGSOthQbefI?autoplay=0&amp;amp;controls=1&amp;amp;end=0&amp;amp;loop=0&amp;amp;mute=0&amp;amp;start=0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The distro stays out of your way as much as possible and lets you build whatever setup you want, be it &lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Content Creation&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Development&lt;/strong&gt; or any combination of all three. Instead of forcing apps or tools you might not want, we leave it all up to you, keeping things bloat-free. It‚Äôs the kind of distro that puts you in control. Need help or want to know more? We‚Äôre always here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;rise--fall&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#rise--fall&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Rise &amp;amp; Fall
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Distro rose to become more popular than I had ever imagined, beating &lt;a href=&#34;https://endeavouros.com&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EndeavourOS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at one point on &lt;a href=&#34;https://distrowatch.com&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DistroWatch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as long as it was &lt;em&gt;Free&lt;/em&gt; and available that is.. Yes, my fellow readers, that was great and all but with every rise comes a hard fall. What I mean by that is, once I added a price tag, things took a hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gnome.org&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gnome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by popular demand brought new challenges on top of everything else&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;donation-wall&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#donation-wall&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Donation-Wall
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started taking on more for the project, like pumping out new versions, the costs just kept growing. Honestly, I‚Äôm one person out here in &lt;strong&gt;Lebanon&lt;/strong&gt;, and let‚Äôs just say it‚Äôs not exactly easy to find a solid job, so keeping things going got pretty tough. That‚Äôs why I had to step back for a bit and rethink everything. I even tried making it just a &lt;em&gt;post-install script&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Vanilla Arch&lt;/em&gt;, and that was okay for a while, but then people kept telling me to bring back the full distro, so I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But keeping things the same just wasn‚Äôt going to cut it if I wanted &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt; to survive. Then I noticed &lt;a href=&#34;https://archcraft.io/premium.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ArchCraft&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; doing their own thing, charging for &lt;em&gt;premium versions&lt;/em&gt;, and it made me think, ‚ÄúHey, maybe I should try something similar.‚Äù That‚Äôs how the whole &lt;em&gt;donation wall&lt;/em&gt; idea was born. If you decide to chip in, you‚Äôre supporting the time and effort I put in, not just paying for an ISO. And relax‚Äîthe code is still totally free; you can always grab it from &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/XeroLinuxDev/xero-build&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Github&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, fork it, tweak it, or do whatever you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now before you say it, I will, &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;But it&amp;rsquo;s not the same !&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;. Honestly, I get that it‚Äôs not exactly the same, hear me out. He gives out these free versions for people to mess around with, but let‚Äôs be real, it‚Äôs all a clever &lt;strong&gt;marketing move&lt;/strong&gt;. Pretty much every product out there has some kind of &lt;em&gt;free demo&lt;/em&gt; that‚Äôs designed to &lt;strong&gt;hook&lt;/strong&gt; you in. The whole point is to get you interested, so you‚Äôll hopefully want to pay for the full or premium version later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt; doesn‚Äôt roll with the same kind of strategy because, honestly, it‚Äôs just too risky. Instead, it offers other ways to get pretty close results but not exactly the same, mostly through a bunch of handy &lt;a href=&#34;https://xerolinux.xyz/scripts/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;scripts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I put out there totally free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be wondering what I mean by &lt;em&gt;too risky&lt;/em&gt;, so here‚Äôs the deal: These scripts are powerful tools aimed mainly at folks comfortable with &lt;strong&gt;Arch Linux&lt;/strong&gt; and who know their way around the command line. They give you loads of flexibility and choice, but they‚Äôre not everyone&amp;rsquo;s cup of tea since they require some Linux know-how. So, rather than locking you into a &lt;em&gt;one-size-fits-all&lt;/em&gt; approach, I prefer giving you options, mostly for the &lt;em&gt;Linux geeks&lt;/em&gt; out there who want full control without the risk of breaking things unintentionally. If you‚Äôre more into clicking around in a GUI, no worries, you can always go with the distro itself or whatever suits your style. It‚Äôs really all about what you want to do and how deep you wanna dive into Linux fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I put out a free version of the distro, most people would probably just stick with it and skip any paid ones. There‚Äôs also no way to make a &lt;em&gt;limited&lt;/em&gt; free version that works right. From being part of the Linux community for a while, I‚Äôve noticed that many people think &lt;em&gt;Free&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Free Open Source&lt;/em&gt; means free beer, which it doesn‚Äôt. It actually means you have the &lt;em&gt;freedom&lt;/em&gt; to use, modify, and share the software however you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why almost no one pays for such projects and we get attacked for charging for them. This has to stop or else projects will continue to fade away!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;wrap-up&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#wrap-up&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Wrap-Up
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, let‚Äôs wrap things up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I know &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt; might not pack as many flashy features as &lt;a href=&#34;https://cachyos.org&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CachyOS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or some of the other distros out there, but that was never really the goal. I wanted to make something different. If you‚Äôre not vibing with the vision behind the project, that‚Äôs totally cool, just use whatever distro works for you.

    Introduction
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months, I‚Äôve been getting asked the same questions again and again: What exactly is &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt;? And why is it locked behind a &lt;em&gt;donation wall&lt;/em&gt;? So, I figured it‚Äôs about time to clear things up once and for all with this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grab a seat and let‚Äôs dive in‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;xerolinux-goal&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#xerolinux-goal&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    XeroLinux Goal
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt; is an &lt;em&gt;Arch-based&lt;/em&gt; Linux distro I built mainly for myself, to make installing Arch easier using &lt;a href=&#34;https://calamares.io&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calamares&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And the desktop environment? Well, it‚Äôs gotta be &lt;a href=&#34;https://kde.org&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KDE Plasma&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, obviously. At first, I went a bit overboard and packed in way too much bloat, kinda like &lt;em&gt;Garuda&lt;/em&gt;, which honestly wasn‚Äôt great. Here‚Äôs a video from the very first release so you can see just how rough it was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
      &lt;iframe allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen&#34; loading=&#34;eager&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/l8Z7fr79A8I?autoplay=0&amp;amp;controls=1&amp;amp;end=0&amp;amp;loop=0&amp;amp;mute=0&amp;amp;start=0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But over time, I kept trimming things down and optimizing until I had a solid base to build on. I didn‚Äôt want every possible piece of software included by default, just the key settings and system tweaks, the stuff that takes the longest to set up. By settings, I mean system optimizations and some &lt;em&gt;ricing&lt;/em&gt;. Why? Because my needs change all the time, and packing everything in would just blow up the ISO size too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúWhat about drivers?‚Äù you might ask. Same deal. My hardware changes now and then, so including every driver under the sun wouldn‚Äôt make sense. Instead, I stick to the basics (&lt;em&gt;kernel drivers&lt;/em&gt;) up front, with options to add more as you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I started sharing the ISO with my close friends, they loved how stable, easy to install, and lightweight it was, so they pushed me to turn it into a proper distro available to everyone. I was hesitant at first, since that meant I‚Äôd be responsible for support, but eventually, I took the plunge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;benefits--features&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#benefits--features&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Benefits &amp;amp; Features
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike many distros packed with tons of features and apps, &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on a smooth, easy installation and helping you learn &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.archlinux.org&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arch Linux&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; through the toolkit we provide. Check out the video below for a look:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
      &lt;iframe allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen&#34; loading=&#34;eager&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/YGSOthQbefI?autoplay=0&amp;amp;controls=1&amp;amp;end=0&amp;amp;loop=0&amp;amp;mute=0&amp;amp;start=0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The distro stays out of your way as much as possible and lets you build whatever setup you want, be it &lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Content Creation&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Development&lt;/strong&gt; or any combination of all three. Instead of forcing apps or tools you might not want, we leave it all up to you, keeping things bloat-free. It‚Äôs the kind of distro that puts you in control. Need help or want to know more? We‚Äôre always here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;rise--fall&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#rise--fall&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Rise &amp;amp; Fall
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Distro rose to become more popular than I had ever imagined, beating &lt;a href=&#34;https://endeavouros.com&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EndeavourOS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at one point on &lt;a href=&#34;https://distrowatch.com&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DistroWatch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as long as it was &lt;em&gt;Free&lt;/em&gt; and available that is.. Yes, my fellow readers, that was great and all but with every rise comes a hard fall. What I mean by that is, once I added a price tag, things took a hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gnome.org&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gnome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by popular demand brought new challenges on top of everything else&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;donation-wall&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#donation-wall&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Donation-Wall
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started taking on more for the project, like pumping out new versions, the costs just kept growing. Honestly, I‚Äôm one person out here in &lt;strong&gt;Lebanon&lt;/strong&gt;, and let‚Äôs just say it‚Äôs not exactly easy to find a solid job, so keeping things going got pretty tough. That‚Äôs why I had to step back for a bit and rethink everything. I even tried making it just a &lt;em&gt;post-install script&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Vanilla Arch&lt;/em&gt;, and that was okay for a while, but then people kept telling me to bring back the full distro, so I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But keeping things the same just wasn‚Äôt going to cut it if I wanted &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt; to survive. Then I noticed &lt;a href=&#34;https://archcraft.io/premium.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ArchCraft&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; doing their own thing, charging for &lt;em&gt;premium versions&lt;/em&gt;, and it made me think, ‚ÄúHey, maybe I should try something similar.‚Äù That‚Äôs how the whole &lt;em&gt;donation wall&lt;/em&gt; idea was born. If you decide to chip in, you‚Äôre supporting the time and effort I put in, not just paying for an ISO. And relax‚Äîthe code is still totally free; you can always grab it from &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/XeroLinuxDev/xero-build&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Github&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, fork it, tweak it, or do whatever you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now before you say it, I will, &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;But it&amp;rsquo;s not the same !&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;. Honestly, I get that it‚Äôs not exactly the same, hear me out. He gives out these free versions for people to mess around with, but let‚Äôs be real, it‚Äôs all a clever &lt;strong&gt;marketing move&lt;/strong&gt;. Pretty much every product out there has some kind of &lt;em&gt;free demo&lt;/em&gt; that‚Äôs designed to &lt;strong&gt;hook&lt;/strong&gt; you in. The whole point is to get you interested, so you‚Äôll hopefully want to pay for the full or premium version later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt; doesn‚Äôt roll with the same kind of strategy because, honestly, it‚Äôs just too risky. Instead, it offers other ways to get pretty close results but not exactly the same, mostly through a bunch of handy &lt;a href=&#34;https://xerolinux.xyz/scripts/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;scripts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I put out there totally free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be wondering what I mean by &lt;em&gt;too risky&lt;/em&gt;, so here‚Äôs the deal: These scripts are powerful tools aimed mainly at folks comfortable with &lt;strong&gt;Arch Linux&lt;/strong&gt; and who know their way around the command line. They give you loads of flexibility and choice, but they‚Äôre not everyone&amp;rsquo;s cup of tea since they require some Linux know-how. So, rather than locking you into a &lt;em&gt;one-size-fits-all&lt;/em&gt; approach, I prefer giving you options, mostly for the &lt;em&gt;Linux geeks&lt;/em&gt; out there who want full control without the risk of breaking things unintentionally. If you‚Äôre more into clicking around in a GUI, no worries, you can always go with the distro itself or whatever suits your style. It‚Äôs really all about what you want to do and how deep you wanna dive into Linux fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I put out a free version of the distro, most people would probably just stick with it and skip any paid ones. There‚Äôs also no way to make a &lt;em&gt;limited&lt;/em&gt; free version that works right. From being part of the Linux community for a while, I‚Äôve noticed that many people think &lt;em&gt;Free&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Free Open Source&lt;/em&gt; means free beer, which it doesn‚Äôt. It actually means you have the &lt;em&gt;freedom&lt;/em&gt; to use, modify, and share the software however you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why almost no one pays for such projects and we get attacked for charging for them. This has to stop or else projects will continue to fade away!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;wrap-up&#34; &gt;

        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Wrap-Up
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, let‚Äôs wrap things up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I know &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt; might not pack as many flashy features as &lt;a href=&#34;https://cachyos.org&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CachyOS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or some of the other distros out there, but that was never really the goal. I wanted to make something different. If you‚Äôre not vibing with the vision behind the project, that‚Äôs totally cool, just use whatever distro works for you. No hard feelings, no judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truth is, if I ever get a little more financially secure, I swear I‚Äôll ditch the price tag entirely and make XeroLinux free for everyone. For now though, this is my only source of income, and things are pretty tight. I just hope folks get where I‚Äôm coming from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huge thanks to everyone who‚Äôs stuck by the project‚Äîwhether you‚Äôve chipped in financially or donated your time. You‚Äôre the reason I‚Äôm able to keep this going, and I seriously appreciate every bit of support.

    Information
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt; has had 2 flavors for a while now, with a 3rd one coming. That being &lt;strong&gt;Gnome&lt;/strong&gt;. I have created that version due to what I thought was popular demand and because many do not like the way the &lt;strong&gt;KDE Plasma&lt;/strong&gt; devs do things, shoving features down our throats without doing much &lt;em&gt;bug-fixing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/u5uXdJZ.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Sales&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Gnome&lt;/strong&gt; version doesn&amp;rsquo;t have many tweaks applied to it simply because I wanted to be stable, having less reasons to break, and the point of it was and still is to stay out of your way so you can do what you wanna do without issue creeping in when least expected. I applied just enough making it more useable/functional than stock &lt;strong&gt;Gnome&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;stalemate&#34; &gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    Stalemate
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question am now asking myself is, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;What the heck happened ?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;. Yeah, coz it&amp;rsquo;s been months now, no one showing any interest in it. As you can see from the image below, only 20 people showed interest since it came out vs &lt;strong&gt;KDE&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rsquo;s 437. Why is that I wonder ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/bGIkm9C.png&#34; alt=&#34;Sales&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#price-or-what-&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Price or what ?
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could it be the price ? I mean it&amp;rsquo;s only $5 more than &lt;strong&gt;KDE&lt;/strong&gt;. Nothing too steep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason behind the price difference is very simple. Since I do not use &lt;strong&gt;Gnome&lt;/strong&gt; on the daily, I would have to do extra work to support it and make sure it keeps working as intended. Extra work means extra cost for me. Think about it this way, would you agree to put in extra hours at work for &lt;strong&gt;NO EXTRA PAY&lt;/strong&gt; ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, it&amp;rsquo;s similar to over-time. Each extra hour you work you get extra &lt;strong&gt;$$$&lt;/strong&gt;, that&amp;rsquo;s how it normally is right ? Same here. I use &lt;strong&gt;KDE Plasma&lt;/strong&gt; on the daily, so it&amp;rsquo;s what I call &lt;em&gt;Normal 9 to 5 working day&lt;/em&gt;. As for &lt;strong&gt;Gnome&lt;/strong&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Over-Time&lt;/em&gt;, hence the extra $5. I hope this clarifies things. I want to offer choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;quality-&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#quality-&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Quality ?
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it&amp;rsquo;s not the price though, then what is it ? Is it the fact that it isn&amp;rsquo;t up to Quality expectations ? I mean I do not want it to be too bloated, or have reasons to break. Stability is what I aim for, not looks as I did with &lt;strong&gt;KDE&lt;/strong&gt;. Do you want more ? I am confused. Please do let me know in the comments below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;wrap-up&#34; &gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#wrap-up&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Wrap-Up
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all that out of the way, I am eager to know what the situation is. Should I keep the &lt;strong&gt;Gnome&lt;/strong&gt; edition out there or not ? Would a &lt;strong&gt;Cosmic Spin&lt;/strong&gt; be worth my time to release once it reaches maturity ? I wonder&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be vocal, without your voice I would be acting in total darkness, and deafness&amp;hellip; After all I am doing this for the community not myself. If I was, then only &lt;strong&gt;KDE&lt;/strong&gt; would exist nothing else..&lt;/p&gt;

I mean I do not want it to be too bloated, or have reasons to break. Stability is what I aim for, not looks as I did with &lt;strong&gt;KDE&lt;/strong&gt;. Do you want more ? I am confused. Please do let me know in the comments below.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    Wrap-Up
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all that out of the way, I am eager to know what the situation is. Should I keep the &lt;strong&gt;Gnome&lt;/strong&gt; edition out there or not ? Would a &lt;strong&gt;Cosmic Spin&lt;/strong&gt; be worth my time to release once it reaches maturity ? I wonder&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be vocal, without your voice I would be acting in total darkness, and deafness&amp;hellip; After all I am doing this for the community not myself. If I was, then only &lt;strong&gt;KDE&lt;/strong&gt; would exist nothing else..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî• üôè&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you don&amp;rsquo;t know by now, or are new to this site/blog, let me give you some background before going through with this post. I am and have been an &lt;a href=&#34;https://archlinux.org&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ArchLinux&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; user for the past 7 years, or so, maintaining my very own &lt;em&gt;Arch-Based&lt;/em&gt; Distro for past 4 almost 5 called &lt;a href=&#34;https://xerolinux.xyz&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I haven&amp;rsquo;t really used anything else long-term since. Until now that is&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    The Challenge
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the introduction out of the way, let me explain the so-called &lt;em&gt;Challenge&lt;/em&gt;. I‚Äôm setting out to use &lt;strong&gt;NixOS&lt;/strong&gt; as my daily driver for an entire year. However, for the sake of transparency, I won‚Äôt be using it exclusively all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned earlier, I‚Äôm a distro maintainer, and there are some critical tasks that simply can‚Äôt be done on NixOS. For example, I can‚Äôt compile or build &lt;strong&gt;Arch&lt;/strong&gt; packages on it, I can‚Äôt maintain my Wiki which uses &lt;strong&gt;MKDocs&lt;/strong&gt; because some plugins are missing on Nix, and I can‚Äôt even build any of the ISOs either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know some of you might suggest &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Just use DistroBox&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; in the comments. I wish it were that simple. &lt;strong&gt;DistroBox&lt;/strong&gt; provides a minimal environment, but I need a full GUI to stay productive. So, no, that‚Äôs not a viable solution. Unfortunately, there isn‚Äôt one. That‚Äôs why during this challenge, I‚Äôll be alternating between &lt;strong&gt;NixOS&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Arch&lt;/strong&gt;, using Arch only when I have specific work to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and did I mention that &lt;strong&gt;NixOS&lt;/strong&gt; is installed on an external NVMe SSD? That makes it very portable!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    NixOS Early days
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having established my background and perspective, it&amp;rsquo;s important to state that it&amp;rsquo;s still too early for me to offer a complete judgment on the distribution or its underlying language. I will be regularly updating this post as I continue my journey, so feel free to bookmark it if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in further insights. As of writing this post, I have been using the system for 7 Days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/sDDUARJ.png&#34; alt=&#34;nixos&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the image above, I was able to import my &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.xerolinux.xyz/rices/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xero-Layan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;KDE Plasma&lt;/strong&gt; rice from &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt;. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that hard once you got the required knowledge. The only complex part was finding all packages I needed on &lt;strong&gt;NixOS&lt;/strong&gt;. Which I have luckily enough. Though the package names were weird to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-nixos-config-file&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-nixos-config-file&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    The NixOS Config File
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After almost a decade of following what I‚Äôll call ‚ÄúThe Linux Way,‚Äù I‚Äôve become very comfortable with the traditional methods, mounting drives, installing packages, and updating my system, knowing that these processes are nearly identical across distributions like &lt;strong&gt;Debian&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Arch&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NixOS&lt;/strong&gt;, however, takes a different approach. While familiar tools like mount are still available, the recommended method is to handle these configurations through the &lt;code&gt;hardware-configuration.nix&lt;/code&gt; file or by defining them in &lt;code&gt;configuration.nix&lt;/code&gt;. The same goes for mounting the various drives, they belong in the config files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve just finalized my &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/DarkXero-dev/Storage/blob/main/NixOS/configuration.nix&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NixOS Configuration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, successfully mounting all my drives, setting &lt;strong&gt;Wayland&lt;/strong&gt; as the default, enabling &lt;strong&gt;ZSH/OhMyZSH&lt;/strong&gt;, and much more. The process was fairly straightforward, made even easier thanks to the support of some good friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;nixos-packages--updates&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#nixos-packages--updates&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    NixOS Packages &amp;amp; Updates
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Installing packages on NixOS is quite different from other distributions. Instead of using a package manager directly, you add the packages you want to the configuration.nix file and then run sudo nixos-rebuild switch. This command pulls the packages from the Nix store and applies the changes declaratively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Updating the system also differs from traditional distros. You run sudo nixos-rebuild switch &amp;ndash;upgrade, which compares versions and upgrades to the latest available packages accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach emphasizes a &lt;em&gt;declarative&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;reproducible&lt;/em&gt; system configuration, rather than manual package installs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;nixos-generations&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#nixos-generations&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    NixOS Generations
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short, every time the system state is rebuilt using &lt;code&gt;nixos-rebuild switch&lt;/code&gt;, a new &lt;a href=&#34;https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Overview_of_the_NixOS_Linux_distribution#Generations&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;generation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is created. You can revert to the previous generation at any time, which is useful if a configuration change (or system update) turns out to be detrimental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can quickly become overwhelming, particularly when dealing with the &lt;em&gt;bootloader&lt;/em&gt;. Accumulating over 100 generations isn&amp;rsquo;t ideal, which is why I&amp;rsquo;ve added an alias to my &lt;code&gt;.bashrc&lt;/code&gt; file. This alias automatically removes all old generations, keeping only the most recent one after I&amp;rsquo;ve confirmed its stability. Feel free to add it to your setup if you find it useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:6;-o-tab-size:6;tab-size:6;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;alias&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;ncg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;nix-collect-garbage --delete-old &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo nix-collect-garbage -d &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo /run/current-system/bin/switch-to-configuration boot&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;flakes--home-manager&#34; &gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    Flakes &amp;amp; Home-Manager
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the get-go I decided I will never use &lt;a href=&#34;https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/index.xhtml#ch-introduction&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Home-Manager&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; thing. I do not like the ideology behind it. I want to keep it simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I am willing to go to the next level with something called &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Flakes&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flakes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Right now though, I am still at the beginning of my &lt;strong&gt;NixOS&lt;/strong&gt; adventure/challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#conclusion&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Conclusion
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a week of use, the system is fully functional for everyday activities like web browsing, watching movies, writing blog posts, and even gaming. I managed to set up &lt;strong&gt;Steam&lt;/strong&gt; and everything needed to enjoy my favorite games. Interestingly, the performance feels slightly better than on &lt;strong&gt;Arch&lt;/strong&gt;, which I find both surprising and impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan to take things slow and steady, moving forward at my own comfortable pace. Once am fully happy with what I have accomplished, and feel comfortable enough, I will be tackling &lt;strong&gt;Flakes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wish me luck&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

I managed to set up &lt;strong&gt;Steam&lt;/strong&gt; and everything needed to enjoy my favorite games. Interestingly, the performance feels slightly better than on &lt;strong&gt;Arch&lt;/strong&gt;, which I find both surprising and impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan to take things slow and steady, moving forward at my own comfortable pace. Once am fully happy with what I have accomplished, and feel comfortable enough, I will be tackling &lt;strong&gt;Flakes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wish me luck&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

    Hello everyone,
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I need to share some of my thoughts and frustrations. If this isn&amp;rsquo;t your cup of tea, feel free to check out other posts. For those sticking around, thank you for lending an ear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing this post wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy; it took a lot of reflection and courage to open up about these feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S: This blog post reflects the thoughts and feelings of a passionate developer navigating the challenging world of FOSS and the struggle for financial stability. Your support and feedback are always appreciated. Now, let‚Äôs dive in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    My Frustration
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I‚Äôve been investing a lot of time and effort into my projects and contributing to &lt;strong&gt;FOSS&lt;/strong&gt; (Free and Open Source Software) wherever possible. While I find this work rewarding, it‚Äôs also been increasingly frustrating. Why? Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spend countless hours working behind the scenes to make everyone‚Äôs life easier. While there are a few of you who go above and beyond to support my work, and I am incredibly grateful for that, it‚Äôs disheartening to see so little engagement overall. Feedback is crucial for improvement, and without issue reports or suggestions, it&amp;rsquo;s challenging to know if I‚Äôm making a real impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;seeking-purpose&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#seeking-purpose&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Seeking Purpose
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, I embarked on this journey for fun and to learn new things. However, lately, I‚Äôve been questioning the purpose behind my efforts. It feels like I‚Äôm stuck in a cycle of constant work with little to show for it. This isn‚Äôt about blaming anyone; it‚Äôs about seeking the motivation to keep going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;monetization-attempts&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#monetization-attempts&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Monetization Attempts
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As my financial situation became more strained, I reluctantly turned to monetization. Many advised me to turn my passion into a viable source of income. So, I tried implementing a &amp;ldquo;pay what you can&amp;rdquo; model, hoping it would help sustain my work. However, this didn‚Äôt go as planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;FOSS&lt;/strong&gt; community, known for its spirit of freedom, often struggles with the concept of financial support for free software. It‚Äôs a complex issue, and while some have been supportive, overall, the response hasn‚Äôt been enough to make a significant difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;health-concerns&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#health-concerns&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Health Concerns
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of these challenges, I have been dealing with significant health issues. Most notably, I have severe dental problems that require a full set of dentures. Not to forget other health issues like Sciatica, blood pressure and more. All this isn‚Äôt cheap, and without stable income, it‚Äôs been impossible to address. These health issues have affected my confidence and my ability to engage publicly, adding another layer of difficulty to my situation. Health must come before everything else, including fun and passion projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stress from these financial and health challenges has also taken a toll on my mental health. I&amp;rsquo;ve been experiencing frequent anxiety and panic attacks, and the constant pressure has led to a deep sense of depression. The overwhelming silence and lack of engagement have exacerbated these feelings, making it even harder to stay motivated and productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-way-forward&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-way-forward&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    The Way Forward
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given these circumstances, I‚Äôm focusing more on my various projects and this blog. Writing provides a creative outlet that isn‚Äôt constrained by algorithms or view counts. I will freely share what I can, not everything. I am currently spending more than the income am getting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main priority now is finding ways to support my financial needs. If and when I achieve that stability, I plan to return to my passion projects with renewed energy and many new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;closing-thoughts&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#closing-thoughts&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Closing Thoughts
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to those of you who continue to support my work. Your appreciation means the world to me and keeps me going even when things get tough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, I need to prioritize my well-being and financial stability. Once those are in place, I‚Äôll be back with future projects. Right now, I‚Äôm dealing with depression, anxiety, and panic attacks due to my job situation and need time to recover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for understanding and supporting me through this journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#am-i-a-developer-&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Am I a Developer ?
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lol, yeah, I know‚Äîit&amp;rsquo;s a question I get a lot. But in my humble opinion, no, I am not. Far from it. I&amp;rsquo;m just a guy who, at most, messes with code‚Äîspecifically &lt;strong&gt;Bash&lt;/strong&gt;. I take what I understand, put it together in a way that makes sense (to me at least), and hope it works. That&amp;rsquo;s all I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
      &lt;iframe allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen&#34; loading=&#34;eager&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/8_K-NOu-STs?autoplay=0&amp;amp;controls=1&amp;amp;end=0&amp;amp;loop=0&amp;amp;mute=0&amp;amp;start=0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if it does work, I&amp;rsquo;m happy and share the result with the &lt;strong&gt;FOSS&lt;/strong&gt; community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;its-fun-until&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#its-fun-until&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    It&amp;rsquo;s fun until&amp;hellip;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing this is super fun and fulfilling‚Äîuntil I hit a brick wall, stop getting new ideas, or can&amp;rsquo;t find a solution to what I&amp;rsquo;m trying to accomplish. Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s super frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I know I can reach out to the &lt;strong&gt;FOSS&lt;/strong&gt; community for help. However, not all of it is sunshine and roses. I try, but I often get more frustrated with the differences of opinion out there. No matter how much I try to satisfy some requests, I can&amp;rsquo;t do it for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I run into some elitists who think their opinion is the only one that matters. I always make the mistake of replying to them when it&amp;rsquo;s better to ignore them. Yes, those types of people exist everywhere‚Äînot just in &lt;strong&gt;FOSS&lt;/strong&gt;. But alas, that&amp;rsquo;s where we feel it the most, especially when we try to monetize our work. But I already discussed that in another post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, once a project is complete, the feeling of accomplishment is so rewarding, lol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sharing-is-caring&#34; &gt;

        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Sharing is caring
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the part where I say: please, don&amp;rsquo;t keep your work to yourself. Share it with the community‚Äîwho knows, maybe you&amp;rsquo;ll find someone who can help take your project to another level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to keep stuff to myself until I began sharing. That&amp;rsquo;s when everything took off, and I was able to help others. If it&amp;rsquo;s not a project, maybe it&amp;rsquo;s the knowledge you&amp;rsquo;ve gained. Share it by helping others when and where you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sharing is caring,&amp;rdquo; as the saying goes. Anyway, I hope this post was a good read. Enjoy! ;)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>R.I.P GamerKing</title>
      <link>/posts/rip-gamerking/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 15 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <author>info@techxero.com (DarkXero)</author>
      <guid>/posts/rip-gamerking/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;in-memoriam&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#in-memoriam&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    In Memoriam
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is with a heavy heart that I share the passing of &lt;strong&gt;GamerKing&lt;/strong&gt;, a remarkable 19-year-old from my region who lived only 20 minutes away. He was not only a brilliant &lt;strong&gt;Linux&lt;/strong&gt; enthusiast but also a vibrant soul who played a significant role in shaping the future of &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt;. His relentless pursuit of perfection and attention to detail, particularly when it came to consistency, pushed the project to heights it would never have reached without his insightful input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/37Ew8GN.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;gk&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will admit, there were times when I disagreed with his ideas, but his persistence, backed by reason and logic, often changed my mind. &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt; carries his imprint, and his contributions will forever be woven into its fabric. In a place like &lt;strong&gt;Lebanon&lt;/strong&gt;, where &lt;strong&gt;Linux&lt;/strong&gt; is a rarity, he stood out as a true gem, his knowledge far surpassing that of most people in our country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For over a year, our country has been engulfed in a conflict, one that escalated into tragic proportions in the last few weeks. It began as a high-tech war, with explosive devices disguised as everyday objects like pagers and walkie-talkies. The violence claimed many lives, and &lt;strong&gt;GamerKing&lt;/strong&gt; was caught in the crossfire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, as of the writing of this post, his neighborhood was hit for the first time, and he suffered severe injuries, losing a significant amount of blood. From his hospital bed, he reached out to me, recounting the terrifying events. The details of his condition were harrowing, but he maintained his characteristic humor, and we joked about the situation, as we often did. It was a brief, bittersweet exchange, and when we said our goodbyes, I was reassured that he would recover. I had no idea it would be the last time we spoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the conflict worsened, bombings crept closer to both of us. I assumed he was resting and chose not to disturb him, unaware of the devastation that was to follow.&lt;/p&gt;

    The Loss
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, as I write this, a massive bombing destroyed a six-building complex near &lt;strong&gt;GamerKing&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rsquo;s location. Soon after, I received a message from his younger brother. At first, I believed it was &lt;strong&gt;GamerKing&lt;/strong&gt; himself, and my immediate question was, &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Are you OK?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; But the reply came from his brother, who, after a moment of silence, shared the heartbreaking news: &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;He told me that if anything happened to me, open Discord and tell Dark&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;rdquo; I asked, trembling, &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Why? What happened?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; After what felt like an eternity, he delivered the words that shattered my world: &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;He just left us&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still don‚Äôt know what took him from us, whether it was his injuries or the bombing‚Äîbut the tragic truth remains: I have lost a dear friend, a colleague, and one of the brightest individuals I have ever had the privilege to know. The shock of his passing has yet to settle in, and I fear it never truly will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will always remember his infectious energy, his humor, and his brilliance. He was the light of &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt;, and his absence will be deeply felt. Please join me in mourning the loss of a truly exceptional man. &lt;strong&gt;Rest in peace, little brother&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    In Memoriam
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is with a heavy heart that I share the passing of &lt;strong&gt;GamerKing&lt;/strong&gt;, a remarkable 19-year-old from my region who lived only 20 minutes away. He was not only a brilliant &lt;strong&gt;Linux&lt;/strong&gt; enthusiast but also a vibrant soul who played a significant role in shaping the future of &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt;. His relentless pursuit of perfection and attention to detail, particularly when it came to consistency, pushed the project to heights it would never have reached without his insightful input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/37Ew8GN.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;gk&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will admit, there were times when I disagreed with his ideas, but his persistence, backed by reason and logic, often changed my mind. &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt; carries his imprint, and his contributions will forever be woven into its fabric. In a place like &lt;strong&gt;Lebanon&lt;/strong&gt;, where &lt;strong&gt;Linux&lt;/strong&gt; is a rarity, he stood out as a true gem, his knowledge far surpassing that of most people in our country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For over a year, our country has been engulfed in a conflict, one that escalated into tragic proportions in the last few weeks. It began as a high-tech war, with explosive devices disguised as everyday objects like pagers and walkie-talkies. The violence claimed many lives, and &lt;strong&gt;GamerKing&lt;/strong&gt; was caught in the crossfire.&lt;/p&gt;

    What&amp;rsquo;s This?
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, after reflecting on my activities and our collective behavior as Linux users, I realized a few things I wanted to share. This post doesn&amp;rsquo;t belong on the main site but here, where I can speak candidly about how things have been and how we, as so-called Linux users, often behave. I&amp;rsquo;m as guilty as anyone else, so let&amp;rsquo;s sit back, relax, grab a cup of coffee or a bottle of beer, and read on.&lt;/p&gt;

    Content Creators
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before diving in, I want to clarify that I am not a content creator. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried many times and failed miserably, so I don&amp;rsquo;t include myself in this group for now. However, I need to address the challenges they face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube content creators (CCs) do a thankless job. It&amp;rsquo;s incredibly hard work, requiring meticulous planning, high-quality equipment, and, above all, an enormous amount of patience. Unfortunately, the comment sections are often filled with toxic trash talk, which can be demoralizing. Reading these negative comments can lead to feelings of depression and inadequacy, making creators feel they are not meeting viewer expectations. This is far from the truth; the reality is that satisfying everyone is impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content creators invest significant time, money, and energy into producing videos that inform, entertain, and educate. Their efforts are crucial for enhancing our understanding and enjoyment of various topics. Even writers like myself sometimes rely on their videos to illustrate points or tools we discuss in our posts. Blog posts and YouTube videos complement each other, making our content more engaging and informative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where I include myself. We do our best to bring you high-quality content. We strive to be as unbiased as possible, but mistakes happen. We are human and sometimes say the wrong things out of frustration, but that&amp;rsquo;s no excuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One common mistake we make is not doing enough research before posting. This can lead to a lack of primary sources to back up our claims, which makes our posts less trustworthy. Recently, it was brought to my attention that I was guilty of this. Instead of pushing away constructive criticism, I embraced it and made sure to do better. Thanks to a user on Discord, I‚Äôve learned to improve, and I thank them for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often overlook the effort and dedication that content creators and writers put into their work. From brainstorming ideas to scripting, filming, editing, and publishing, every step requires significant effort and attention to detail. They often juggle these tasks alongside their personal and professional lives, making their commitment even more commendable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both content creators and writers face the challenge of staying updated with the latest trends, technologies, and viewer preferences. This constant evolution demands flexibility and a willingness to learn and adapt. Despite these challenges, many persist, driven by their passion and dedication to their craft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As writers and bloggers, we pour our hearts into our work, aiming to provide valuable insights and information. We strive to deliver accurate and engaging content, but we are not infallible. Constructive feedback helps us grow and improve, enabling us to produce better content for our readers. It&amp;rsquo;s essential to recognize that writing is an iterative process. Each piece we publish is a step toward improvement. Constructive criticism, when offered kindly and thoughtfully, is a valuable tool that helps us refine our skills and enhance the quality of our work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The F.O.S.S. Linux community thrives on collaboration and mutual support. By fostering a positive and inclusive environment, we can attract more people and encourage contributions. Let&amp;rsquo;s move away from harsh judgments and toward constructive dialogues that promote growth and understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we encounter content we don&amp;rsquo;t agree with, let&amp;rsquo;s engage in respectful discussions. Share your perspectives, offer suggestions, and be open to different viewpoints. This approach enriches our community and helps content creators and writers deliver better content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of judging writers and content creators harshly, provide constructive criticism and exchange ideas to help us improve and bring you more useful content. Many of us, myself included, have been guilty of negativity. This message serves as a reminder to be more supportive. Let&amp;rsquo;s help each other grow in the F.O.S.S. Linux community and attract more people by discussing and recommending content thoughtfully.&lt;/p&gt;
