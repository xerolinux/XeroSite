    The Move
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I recently decided to &lt;em&gt;move&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;Serbia&lt;/strong&gt; — well, “move” might be a bit of an overstatement since it’s only temporary. The idea is to focus on my health, which hasn’t exactly been at its best lately. Living here is also a lot more affordable than back home in &lt;strong&gt;Lebanon&lt;/strong&gt;, which definitely helps since my only income at the moment comes from &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt;. Every little bit counts until I find a more stable source of income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move itself went surprisingly smoothly. The only tough part was a long 7-hour layover in &lt;strong&gt;Athens&lt;/strong&gt;. My cousin was with me, and we walked so much that my legs nearly gave out, but once I finally landed, got to the apartment, and crashed for a solid 12 hours, things started falling into place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here’s a little breakdown of what I’ve been dealing with and how I’m handling it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;adhd--mental-health&#34; &gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#adhd--mental-health&#34;&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    ADHD &amp;amp; Mental Health
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My ADHD has been acting up lately, probably because I haven’t been managing it properly. On top of that, I recently found out I also have something called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.verywellmind.com/functional-freeze-11809716&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Functional Freeze&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It explains so much. Basically, it’s when your brain just refuses to let you do even the simplest things, making them feel like climbing a mountain barefoot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I finally decided to see a therapist, who’s helping me through it and recommended some medication along with monthly sessions. It’s a work in progress, but at least I’m getting the help I need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for my anxiety and depression — those are still hanging around, but I’ll deal with them once the ADHD is under better control. One step at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;physical-health--other-stuff&#34; &gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#physical-health--other-stuff&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Physical Health &amp;amp; Other Stuff
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the physical side of things, I had a rough time with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hemorrhoids/symptoms-causes/syc-20360268&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hemorrhoids&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (fun times, right?). Thankfully, that’s now under control thanks to meds and a change in habits — turns out, going overboard on spicy food wasn’t doing me any favors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then there’s the muscle situation. My physical therapist basically told me my muscles are “half asleep.” I’ve been way too sedentary, sitting at my desk all day. So now I’m taking 3km walks every other day (when the weather allows) and planning to join a 12-session program to strengthen my back and core, once my budget allows it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But hey, nothing major’s wrong. I’m not dying or anything like that, which is always good news, right? 😅&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;youtube-plans&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#youtube-plans&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    YouTube Plans
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I brought along my mic, webcam, and MiniPC to maybe get back into &lt;strong&gt;YouTube&lt;/strong&gt; content… but I didn’t realize how much I’d miss my 3-monitor setup! Working with just one feels like trying to juggle blindfolded. Without a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.elgato.com/us/en/p/stream-deck&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;StreamDeck&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, managing &lt;strong&gt;OBS-Studio&lt;/strong&gt; scenes and effects on a single screen is a pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know there are phone apps that try to replace the &lt;strong&gt;StreamDeck&lt;/strong&gt;, but let’s just say they’re &lt;em&gt;not quite there yet&lt;/em&gt;. So I’ve decided to put &lt;strong&gt;YouTube&lt;/strong&gt; on hold (again) until I’m back home after &lt;strong&gt;Christmas&lt;/strong&gt;. I’ve got a few exciting announcements planned for when that happens, can’t wait to share more soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I don’t know how some of you manage with just one monitor… total respect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;wrapping-it-up&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#wrapping-it-up&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Wrapping It Up
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short, I’ve got to move more, take better care of my brain, and keep working on &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt; one step at a time. Thankfully, nothing too serious is standing in my way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I ask is for a little patience while I get my life and health back on track. I’ll still be around and available if you need me, I just need to pace myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve got plenty of plans for &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt;, and I’m excited for what’s ahead. It’ll just take some time, care, and a slower pace to make it all happen without burning out again.&lt;/p&gt;

    The Challenge
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building a Linux distribution has been a deeply rewarding project, but I’ve recently hit a significant obstacle. Despite investing considerable time and effort, my knowledge and skills have reached their limit. There are many improvements I want to make, yet the technical complexity and absence of clear, comprehensive guides on how to build and maintain a distro make progress difficult. Unlike other software projects, the documentation is fragmented and incomplete, leaving much to be figured out individually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-reality&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-reality&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    The Reality
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not a professional developer, and learning to navigate the intricate systems behind a Linux distribution has proven much harder than I anticipated. The steep learning curve and complexity of tasks such as kernel customization, package management, and system integration are overwhelming. This situation isn’t about lacking motivation or dedication — it’s a practical recognition of my current capabilities in a very technical domain.&lt;/p&gt;

        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    The Call for Help
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To move forward, the project desperately needs new contributors. Collaboration is crucial to overcoming these challenges and accelerating development. Whether you’re experienced with Linux, coding, documentation, or community support, your contribution matters. If interested, please reach out to me on Discord, or in the comments below. Together, we can make the Distro stronger and expand its potential.&lt;/p&gt;

        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Moving Forward
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the project started as a solo effort, its future depends on building a community. By pooling our skills and resources, what seemed impossible alone can become achievable. This is an open invitation to join in and help shape something meaningful in the open-source world. Let’s work together to take this project to the next level.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#introduction&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Introduction
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been on &lt;strong&gt;iOS&lt;/strong&gt; for so long that at this point I’m pretty sure Apple has my neurological patterns stored somewhere in &lt;strong&gt;iCloud&lt;/strong&gt;. My iPhone 11 has been a loyal soldier, survived drops, travel, stress, boredom scrolling, and maybe a few emotional support duties. After nearly six years, it still looks brand-new… but the battery? Yeah, it’s at &lt;strong&gt;76%&lt;/strong&gt;. Basically it’s the tech equivalent of: “Grandpa needs to sit down for a moment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the fact that Apple is dropping support for it next major update, and suddenly my phone feels like it’s standing outside the club while the new models walk in with VIP passes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew it was time to upgrade. But this time, thanks to life being life, I didn’t have the financial comfort to stay with &lt;strong&gt;Apple&lt;/strong&gt;. So… &lt;strong&gt;Android&lt;/strong&gt; it is. Yes, I’m moving to the &lt;strong&gt;Dark Side&lt;/strong&gt;.Last time I used &lt;strong&gt;Android&lt;/strong&gt;, things were chaotic, laggy, and looked like a UI designer was drunk at 3AM. But times change, right? Right…?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-process&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-process&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    The Process
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as we all know, when it comes to &lt;strong&gt;Android&lt;/strong&gt; the landscape is huge ! Eventhough I limited myself to upper mid-range phones, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t narrow it down a lot. So I had to keep creating check boxes to tick. The more I did the lesser choice I had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What matters most to me is not to get a phone from a lesser known manufacturer, since the lesser known it is the worse support gets. I needed a phone from a reputable OEM, with a promise of at least 4 years of &lt;strong&gt;MAJOR&lt;/strong&gt; OS updates, nevermind security ones. Also one that has near flagship specs so it lasts for that long without it slowing down too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-choice&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-choice&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    The Choice
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever tried choosing an &lt;strong&gt;Android&lt;/strong&gt; phone, you know the experience: the more you look, the more confused you get. The “options” page becomes a maze, and before you know it, you’re comparing devices that only exist in Japan for six weeks a year. Meanwhile on iOS it’s like: small, medium, large. Done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to be logical. I kept adding requirements, good support, not some random brand nobody’s heard of, something that will last a few years without turning into a brick. And every time I added a requirement, the list of possible phones shrank like it owed me money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I ended up with three brands circling my brain: &lt;strong&gt;Google&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Samsung&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;OnePlus&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s when I entered the YouTube Rabbit Hole of Doom — review after review, comparison after comparison, until I started recognizing tech reviewers by the shape of their thumbnails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Pixel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gsmarena.com/google_pixel_9a-13478.php&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Pixel 9a&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; really tempted me. Seven years of updates? &lt;a href=&#34;https://grapheneos.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GrapheneOS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; support? Clean software? Yes, please. But then reality slapped me, it’s the same size as my &lt;strong&gt;iPhone 11&lt;/strong&gt;. I’ve been staring at the same-sized screen for years, I deserve more. I want a phone that feels like a small billboard, not a sticky note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samsung&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung was the next contestant. Everyone recommends Samsung like it’s some sacred rule of the internet. And at first glance, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_a56-13603.php&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Galaxy A56&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; sounded great. Until I remembered Samsung loves stuffing apps into their phones like they’re packing for a month-long holiday. Duplicate apps everywhere, performance just “okay,” and custom ROM support? Nonexistent. Basically it felt like buying a phone that comes pre-loaded with chores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OnePlus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then came &lt;strong&gt;OnePlus&lt;/strong&gt;. I’ve owned a OnePlus before, the legendary &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_6t-9350.php&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;**OnePlus 6t&lt;/a&gt;, from the era before they fully merged into the &lt;strong&gt;OPPO&lt;/strong&gt; hive mind, so at least the name felt familiar. The more I watched reviews, the more it started feeling like the middle ground I needed. Not perfect, not awful, not overpriced. Just… comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So that’s how I ended up picking the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_nord_5_5g-13992.php&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OnePlus Nord 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. No dramatic music or fireworks, just relief that the search was over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For around &lt;strong&gt;350 euros&lt;/strong&gt;, I got something that doesn’t feel cheap, doesn’t feel outdated, and doesn’t feel like it’s going to scream for mercy in two years. With its big display, fast chip, and enough storage to hold every meme the internet throws at me, it felt like the least headache-inducing choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do I trust &lt;strong&gt;OnePlus&lt;/strong&gt; to keep their promises about four major OS updates and six years of security patches? Look… let’s just say I’m optimistic. And if I’m wrong, you’ll hear me complaining about it loudly in six months.&lt;/p&gt;

    Conclusion
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to choose an upper mid-range &lt;strong&gt;Android&lt;/strong&gt; phone is honestly wild. One minute you think you’ve found “the one,” the next minute you find a model that only exists in &lt;strong&gt;Lithuania&lt;/strong&gt; with twice the specs for half the price. It’s exhausting. This is why &lt;strong&gt;iPhones&lt;/strong&gt; were easy: three models and done. No thinking required. Just if wallet will hurt n complain or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m still a bit sad to leave &lt;strong&gt;iOS&lt;/strong&gt;, it’s familiar, consistent, and predictable. But at the same time, there’s something fun about rediscovering &lt;strong&gt;Android&lt;/strong&gt; with fresh eyes. Maybe I’ll love it. Maybe I’ll regret everything. That’s part of the adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ll post an update six months into owning the &lt;strong&gt;Nord 5&lt;/strong&gt;, assuming I haven’t rage-thrown it into the sea or sold it to buy &lt;strong&gt;Lebanese&lt;/strong&gt; snacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until then, feel free to check out the device comparison I used on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gsmarena.com/compare.php3?idPhone1=13992&amp;amp;idPhone2=13478&amp;amp;idPhone3=13603&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GSM-Arene&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    Introduction
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been on &lt;strong&gt;iOS&lt;/strong&gt; for so long that at this point I’m pretty sure Apple has my neurological patterns stored somewhere in &lt;strong&gt;iCloud&lt;/strong&gt;. My iPhone 11 has been a loyal soldier, survived drops, travel, stress, boredom scrolling, and maybe a few emotional support duties. After nearly six years, it still looks brand-new… but the battery? Yeah, it’s at &lt;strong&gt;76%&lt;/strong&gt;. Basically it’s the tech equivalent of: “Grandpa needs to sit down for a moment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add the fact that Apple is dropping support for it next major update, and suddenly my phone feels like it’s standing outside the club while the new models walk in with VIP passes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew it was time to upgrade. But this time, thanks to life being life, I didn’t have the financial comfort to stay with &lt;strong&gt;Apple&lt;/strong&gt;. So… &lt;strong&gt;Android&lt;/strong&gt; it is. Yes, I’m moving to the &lt;strong&gt;Dark Side&lt;/strong&gt;.Last time I used &lt;strong&gt;Android&lt;/strong&gt;, things were chaotic, laggy, and looked like a UI designer was drunk at 3AM. But times change, right? Right…?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-process&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-process&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    The Process
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as we all know, when it comes to &lt;strong&gt;Android&lt;/strong&gt; the landscape is huge ! Eventhough I limited myself to upper mid-range phones, that doesn&amp;rsquo;t narrow it down a lot. So I had to keep creating check boxes to tick. The more I did the lesser choice I had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What matters most to me is not to get a phone from a lesser known manufacturer, since the lesser known it is the worse support gets. I needed a phone from a reputable OEM, with a promise of at least 4 years of &lt;strong&gt;MAJOR&lt;/strong&gt; OS updates, nevermind security ones. Also one that has near flagship specs so it lasts for that long without it slowing down too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-choice&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-choice&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    The Choice
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve ever tried choosing an &lt;strong&gt;Android&lt;/strong&gt; phone, you know the experience: the more you look, the more confused you get. The “options” page becomes a maze, and before you know it, you’re comparing devices that only exist in Japan for six weeks a year. Meanwhile on iOS it’s like: small, medium, large. Done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to be logical. I kept adding requirements, good support, not some random brand nobody’s heard of, something that will last a few years without turning into a brick. And every time I added a requirement, the list of possible phones shrank like it owed me money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually I ended up with three brands circling my brain: &lt;strong&gt;Google&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Samsung&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;OnePlus&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that’s when I entered the YouTube Rabbit Hole of Doom — review after review, comparison after comparison, until I started recognizing tech reviewers by the shape of their thumbnails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Pixel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gsmarena.com/google_pixel_9a-13478.php&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Pixel 9a&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; really tempted me. Seven years of updates? &lt;a href=&#34;https://grapheneos.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GrapheneOS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; support? Clean software? Yes, please. But then reality slapped me, it’s the same size as my &lt;strong&gt;iPhone 11&lt;/strong&gt;. I’ve been staring at the same-sized screen for years, I deserve more. I want a phone that feels like a small billboard, not a sticky note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samsung&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung was the next contestant. Everyone recommends Samsung like it’s some sacred rule of the internet.

    Introduction
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have recently discovered an awesome &lt;strong&gt;A.I Music Generation&lt;/strong&gt; service called &lt;a href=&#34;https://suno.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suno&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s so amazing I decided to fork up the $8/month to get access to the &lt;em&gt;Pro&lt;/em&gt; version that generates more realistic vocals and has tons of more features, like accuracy control, custom audio and lyrics and so much more. It will blow your mind !!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had so much fun with it I decided to create songs for &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Linux&lt;/strong&gt;. Below you will find a few of them embedded&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#introduction&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Introduction
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately I’ve been staring at my Discord server wondering what the heck to do with it. I created it to support &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt; users, and while it still serves that purpose, it’s been feeling kind of&amp;hellip; empty. People join, sometimes leave the same day, and the overall vibe feels more like a ghost town than a growing community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not sure if I need to rethink how I’m using it, or if it’s just not clicking with folks the way I hoped. Either way, I’d love to hear your thoughts if you&amp;rsquo;re part of it, or even if you&amp;rsquo;re not. What would make you want to stick around?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grab a seat and let’s dissect this…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;serve-the-users&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#serve-the-users&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Serve the users
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m part of a bunch of distro-specific servers like &lt;strong&gt;CachyOS&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;PikaOS&lt;/strong&gt;, and a few others, and honestly, they’re buzzing with activity. There’s always something going on, and the way they support their communities is something I really admire. That’s kind of what I wanted for &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt;, a place where users could come together, talk about the distro, its related projects, and just geek out over Linux stuff in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But yeah&amp;hellip; that’s not how it’s playing out right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;grow-baby-grow&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#grow-baby-grow&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Grow baby grow
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another big reason I created the server is simple, without input, how am I supposed to grow the project? I mean, seriously. I know what works for me, but &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt; was never just about me. It was built with users in mind. I wanted to make Arch more accessible and help people learn how to actually enjoy using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are channels on the server specifically for feedback and ideas, but they’re mostly empty. No one shares anything, yet somehow I still get called out for not listening or not caring. What?! I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; care. But if no one speaks up, how can I improve anything? Growth only happens when there’s engagement, it’s a team effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;future-plans&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#future-plans&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Future plans
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really love the idea of having a space where all &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt; fans, users, and future users can come together to chat about Linux and all things &lt;strong&gt;FOSS&lt;/strong&gt;. That was the dream. But with barely any activity, I’m starting to think it might just be better to shut it down. I can’t even get it to the point where Discord allows me to mark it as discoverable. It’s frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funny thing is, I had a server before this one that was way more active. I shut it down because the toxicity got out of hand and I couldn’t manage it anymore. This new one is the exact opposite — barely a pulse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;your-voice&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#your-voice&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Your voice
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, so here’s the deal, this time, unlike the last, I’m giving &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; the chance to speak up before I make any final decisions. Should I shut the Discord server down, or keep it around a bit longer and try to breathe some life into it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this post gets no replies, I’ll take that silence as a loud, screaming &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;YES, KILL IT!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not trying to be dramatic, but I honestly need to know if anyone still finds value in it. So if you care, even a little, now’s the time to say something. Drop your thoughts, ideas, or even just a quick “keep it going”, anything helps. Otherwise, well… I’ll assume it’s time to let it go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;wrapping-it-up&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#wrapping-it-up&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Wrapping it up
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, I’m not here to force anything. I just want &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt; to be more than a project sitting on a repo, I want it to be something people connect with, contribute to, and enjoy using. Whether that happens through Discord or another path entirely, I’m open to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post isn’t about guilt-tripping anyone. It’s just me being real. If there&amp;rsquo;s still interest, I’ll gladly keep things going and explore ways to make the server more useful and fun. If not, that’s okay too. Projects evolve, and maybe it’s time for this one (server) to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Either way, I appreciate every single person who’s been part of the journey so far. Let’s see where it goes from here. &lt;a href=&#34;https://discord.xerolinux.xyz&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check The Server&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading. ❤️🔥🙏&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>/posts/try-before-buy/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 26 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#introduction&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Introduction
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people ask for a &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; version of &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt; so they can try it before deciding to donate. While I completely understand the wish to test it first, I’m unable to offer a free version. The reason is that if I did, many might use it forever without supporting the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don’t worry! There is still a way to get a feel for what this distro offers before you decide to commit. It takes a little more effort, but it’s simple to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grab a seat and let’s dive in…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;xerolinux-de-script&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#xerolinux-de-script&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    XeroLinux D.E Script
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to experience what &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt; is all about, I’ve got you covered! I’ve created a special script that lets you install a &lt;em&gt;pure vanilla&lt;/em&gt; version of &lt;strong&gt;KDE Plasma&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Gnome&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;XFCE&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Hyprland&lt;/strong&gt;, or even &lt;strong&gt;Cosmic&lt;/strong&gt; (Alpha), completely free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just follow the simple guide on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.xerolinux.xyz/script/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XeroWiki&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, we offer &lt;strong&gt;KDE Plasma&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Gnome&lt;/strong&gt; as our main options, so start with either one to get the real &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt; feel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/wDv1PAk.png&#34; alt=&#34;DEScript&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have your preferred desktop environment installed, simply launch the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.xerolinux.xyz/xlapit/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toolkit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. You can find it in the app menu or just open a terminal and type &lt;code&gt;clear &amp;amp;&amp;amp; xero-cli&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then choose option &lt;code&gt;4&lt;/code&gt; labeled &lt;code&gt;Customization&lt;/code&gt;. If you picked &lt;strong&gt;KDE Plasma&lt;/strong&gt;, select &lt;code&gt;x. XeroLinux&#39;s Layan Rice (Vanilla KDE)&lt;/code&gt;. If you chose &lt;strong&gt;Gnome&lt;/strong&gt;, go for &lt;code&gt;z. Apply XeroLinux Gnome Settings (Vanilla Gnome)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sit back and watch the magic happen, then reboot to enjoy the experience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/kGAUs3f.png&#34; alt=&#34;Toolkit&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    Introduction
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many people ask for a &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; version of &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt; so they can try it before deciding to donate. While I completely understand the wish to test it first, I’m unable to offer a free version. The reason is that if I did, many might use it forever without supporting the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But don’t worry! There is still a way to get a feel for what this distro offers before you decide to commit. It takes a little more effort, but it’s simple to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grab a seat and let’s dive in…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;xerolinux-de-script&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#xerolinux-de-script&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    XeroLinux D.E Script
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to experience what &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt; is all about, I’ve got you covered! I’ve created a special script that lets you install a &lt;em&gt;pure vanilla&lt;/em&gt; version of &lt;strong&gt;KDE Plasma&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Gnome&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;XFCE&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Hyprland&lt;/strong&gt;, or even &lt;strong&gt;Cosmic&lt;/strong&gt; (Alpha), completely free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just follow the simple guide on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.xerolinux.xyz/script/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XeroWiki&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, we offer &lt;strong&gt;KDE Plasma&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Gnome&lt;/strong&gt; as our main options, so start with either one to get the real &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt; feel!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/wDv1PAk.png&#34; alt=&#34;DEScript&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you have your preferred desktop environment installed, simply launch the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.xerolinux.xyz/xlapit/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toolkit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. You can find it in the app menu or just open a terminal and type &lt;code&gt;clear &amp;amp;&amp;amp; xero-cli&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then choose option &lt;code&gt;4&lt;/code&gt; labeled &lt;code&gt;Customization&lt;/code&gt;. If you picked &lt;strong&gt;KDE Plasma&lt;/strong&gt;, select &lt;code&gt;x. XeroLinux&#39;s Layan Rice (Vanilla KDE)&lt;/code&gt;. If you chose &lt;strong&gt;Gnome&lt;/strong&gt;, go for &lt;code&gt;z. Apply XeroLinux Gnome Settings (Vanilla Gnome)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sit back and watch the magic happen, then reboot to enjoy the experience!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/kGAUs3f.png&#34; alt=&#34;Toolkit&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s it, really! You won’t be getting &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; the distro offers, just a taste. Think of the &lt;em&gt;Script + Toolkit&lt;/em&gt; as a way to get a demo of what &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt; has in store for you.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    Benefits
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The great thing about all this is that you’ll learn how to install &lt;strong&gt;Arch Linux&lt;/strong&gt; and get a real feel for what you’ll get if you decide to donate to the project.&lt;/p&gt;

    Background
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you don&amp;rsquo;t know by now, or are new to this site/blog, let me give you some background before going through with this post. I am and have been an &lt;a href=&#34;https://archlinux.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ArchLinux&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; user for the past 7 years, or so, maintaining my very own &lt;em&gt;Arch-Based&lt;/em&gt; Distro for past 4 almost 5 called &lt;a href=&#34;https://xerolinux.xyz&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I haven&amp;rsquo;t really used anything else long-term since. Until now that is&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
      &lt;iframe allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen&#34; loading=&#34;eager&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/lsYg6-wUWXw?autoplay=0&amp;amp;controls=1&amp;amp;end=0&amp;amp;loop=0&amp;amp;mute=0&amp;amp;start=0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-challenge&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-challenge&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    The Challenge
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the introduction out of the way, let me explain the so-called &lt;em&gt;Challenge&lt;/em&gt;. I’m setting out to use &lt;strong&gt;NixOS&lt;/strong&gt; as my daily driver for an entire year. However, for the sake of transparency, I won’t be using it exclusively all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned earlier, I’m a distro maintainer, and there are some critical tasks that simply can’t be done on NixOS. For example, I can’t compile or build &lt;strong&gt;Arch&lt;/strong&gt; packages on it, I can’t maintain my Wiki which uses &lt;strong&gt;MKDocs&lt;/strong&gt; because some plugins are missing on Nix, and I can’t even build any of the ISOs either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know some of you might suggest &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Just use DistroBox&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; in the comments. I wish it were that simple. &lt;strong&gt;DistroBox&lt;/strong&gt; provides a minimal environment, but I need a full GUI to stay productive. So, no, that’s not a viable solution. Unfortunately, there isn’t one. That’s why during this challenge, I’ll be alternating between &lt;strong&gt;NixOS&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Arch&lt;/strong&gt;, using Arch only when I have specific work to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and did I mention that &lt;strong&gt;NixOS&lt;/strong&gt; is installed on an external NVMe SSD? That makes it very portable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;nixos-early-days&#34; &gt;

        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    NixOS Early days
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having established my background and perspective, it&amp;rsquo;s important to state that it&amp;rsquo;s still too early for me to offer a complete judgment on the distribution or its underlying language. I will be regularly updating this post as I continue my journey, so feel free to bookmark it if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in further insights. As of writing this post, I have been using the system for 7 Days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/sDDUARJ.png&#34; alt=&#34;nixos&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the image above, I was able to import my &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.xerolinux.xyz/rices/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xero-Layan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;KDE Plasma&lt;/strong&gt; rice from &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt;. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that hard once you got the required knowledge. The only complex part was finding all packages I needed on &lt;strong&gt;NixOS&lt;/strong&gt;. Which I have luckily enough. Though the package names were weird to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-nixos-config-file&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-nixos-config-file&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    The NixOS Config File
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After almost a decade of following what I’ll call “The Linux Way,” I’ve become very comfortable with the traditional methods, mounting drives, installing packages, and updating my system, knowing that these processes are nearly identical across distributions like &lt;strong&gt;Debian&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Arch&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NixOS&lt;/strong&gt;, however, takes a different approach. While familiar tools like mount are still available, the recommended method is to handle these configurations through the &lt;code&gt;hardware-configuration.nix&lt;/code&gt; file or by defining them in &lt;code&gt;configuration.nix&lt;/code&gt;. The same goes for mounting the various drives, they belong in the config files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve just finalized my &lt;strong&gt;NixOS Configuration&lt;/strong&gt;, successfully mounting all my drives, setting &lt;strong&gt;Wayland&lt;/strong&gt; as the default, enabling &lt;strong&gt;ZSH/OhMyZSH&lt;/strong&gt;, and much more. The process was fairly straightforward, made even easier thanks to the support of some good friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;nixos-packages--updates&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#nixos-packages--updates&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    NixOS Packages &amp;amp; Updates
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Installing packages on NixOS is quite different from other distributions. Instead of using a package manager directly, you add the packages you want to the &lt;code&gt;configuration.nix&lt;/code&gt; file and then run sudo nixos-rebuild switch. This command pulls the packages from the Nix store and applies the changes declaratively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Updating the system also differs from traditional distros. You run sudo nixos-rebuild switch &amp;ndash;upgrade, which compares versions and upgrades to the latest available packages accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach emphasizes a &lt;em&gt;declarative&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;reproducible&lt;/em&gt; system configuration, rather than manual package installs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;nixos-generations&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#nixos-generations&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    NixOS Generations
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short, every time the system state is rebuilt using &lt;code&gt;nixos-rebuild switch&lt;/code&gt;, a new &lt;a href=&#34;https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Overview_of_the_NixOS_Linux_distribution#Generations&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;generation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is created. You can revert to the previous generation at any time, which is useful if a configuration change (or system update) turns out to be detrimental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can quickly become overwhelming, particularly when dealing with the &lt;em&gt;bootloader&lt;/em&gt;. Accumulating over 100 generations isn&amp;rsquo;t ideal, which is why I&amp;rsquo;ve added an alias to my &lt;code&gt;.bashrc&lt;/code&gt; file. This alias automatically removes all old generations, keeping only the most recent one after I&amp;rsquo;ve confirmed its stability. Feel free to add it to your setup if you find it useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:6;-o-tab-size:6;tab-size:6;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;alias&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;ncg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;nix-collect-garbage --delete-old &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo nix-collect-garbage -d &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo /run/current-system/bin/switch-to-configuration boot&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;flakes--home-manager&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#flakes--home-manager&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Flakes &amp;amp; Home-Manager
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the get-go I decided I will never use &lt;a href=&#34;https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/index.xhtml#ch-introduction&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Home-Manager&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; thing. I do not like the ideology behind it. I want to keep it simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I am willing to go to the next level with something called &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Flakes&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flakes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Right now though, I am still at the beginning of my &lt;strong&gt;NixOS&lt;/strong&gt; adventure/challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;update-1&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#update-1&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Update 1
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After about &lt;strong&gt;2 weeks&lt;/strong&gt; of poking around and tweaking things, I finally felt chill enough to jump into the world of &lt;strong&gt;Flakes&lt;/strong&gt;. If I’m honest, the biggest reason was my growing obsession with &lt;strong&gt;Flatpaks&lt;/strong&gt;. I wanted a straightforward, &lt;em&gt;declarative&lt;/em&gt; way to install them, and &lt;strong&gt;Flakes&lt;/strong&gt; was basically my only escape hatch for making it happen. So, I finally crossed that line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/JGD3Bfp.png&#34; alt=&#34;XeroNix&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a ton else has changed, you know how it goes with these setups, but I did have my own little victory: I managed to get &lt;strong&gt;Virt-Manager&lt;/strong&gt; all set up, with the networking actually working for once (which, if you know, you know how annoying that can be). It felt pretty nice pulling all these pieces together. There’s something satisfying about seeing everything actually work after a bunch of trial and error !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access my &lt;strong&gt;Flakes&lt;/strong&gt; on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/DarkXero-dev/XeroNix&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XeroNix Repo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#conclusion&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Conclusion
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After two weeks of use, the system is fully functional for everyday activities like web browsing, watching movies, writing blog posts, and even gaming. I managed to set up &lt;strong&gt;Steam&lt;/strong&gt; and everything needed to enjoy my favorite games. Interestingly, the performance feels slightly better than on &lt;strong&gt;Arch&lt;/strong&gt;, which I find both surprising and impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still taking things slow and steady, moving forward at my own comfortable pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wish me luck&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    The Challenge
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the introduction out of the way, let me explain the so-called &lt;em&gt;Challenge&lt;/em&gt;. I’m setting out to use &lt;strong&gt;NixOS&lt;/strong&gt; as my daily driver for an entire year. However, for the sake of transparency, I won’t be using it exclusively all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned earlier, I’m a distro maintainer, and there are some critical tasks that simply can’t be done on NixOS. For example, I can’t compile or build &lt;strong&gt;Arch&lt;/strong&gt; packages on it, I can’t maintain my Wiki which uses &lt;strong&gt;MKDocs&lt;/strong&gt; because some plugins are missing on Nix, and I can’t even build any of the ISOs either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know some of you might suggest &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Just use DistroBox&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; in the comments. I wish it were that simple. &lt;strong&gt;DistroBox&lt;/strong&gt; provides a minimal environment, but I need a full GUI to stay productive. So, no, that’s not a viable solution. Unfortunately, there isn’t one. That’s why during this challenge, I’ll be alternating between &lt;strong&gt;NixOS&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Arch&lt;/strong&gt;, using Arch only when I have specific work to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and did I mention that &lt;strong&gt;NixOS&lt;/strong&gt; is installed on an external NVMe SSD? That makes it very portable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;nixos-early-days&#34; &gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#nixos-early-days&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    NixOS Early days
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having established my background and perspective, it&amp;rsquo;s important to state that it&amp;rsquo;s still too early for me to offer a complete judgment on the distribution or its underlying language. I will be regularly updating this post as I continue my journey, so feel free to bookmark it if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in further insights. As of writing this post, I have been using the system for 7 Days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/sDDUARJ.png&#34; alt=&#34;nixos&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see from the image above, I was able to import my &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.xerolinux.xyz/rices/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Xero-Layan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;KDE Plasma&lt;/strong&gt; rice from &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt;. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that hard once you got the required knowledge. The only complex part was finding all packages I needed on &lt;strong&gt;NixOS&lt;/strong&gt;. Which I have luckily enough. Though the package names were weird to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-nixos-config-file&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-nixos-config-file&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    The NixOS Config File
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After almost a decade of following what I’ll call “The Linux Way,” I’ve become very comfortable with the traditional methods, mounting drives, installing packages, and updating my system, knowing that these processes are nearly identical across distributions like &lt;strong&gt;Debian&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Arch&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NixOS&lt;/strong&gt;, however, takes a different approach. While familiar tools like mount are still available, the recommended method is to handle these configurations through the &lt;code&gt;hardware-configuration.nix&lt;/code&gt; file or by defining them in &lt;code&gt;configuration.nix&lt;/code&gt;. The same goes for mounting the various drives, they belong in the config files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve just finalized my &lt;strong&gt;NixOS Configuration&lt;/strong&gt;, successfully mounting all my drives, setting &lt;strong&gt;Wayland&lt;/strong&gt; as the default, enabling &lt;strong&gt;ZSH/OhMyZSH&lt;/strong&gt;, and much more. The process was fairly straightforward, made even easier thanks to the support of some good friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;nixos-packages--updates&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#nixos-packages--updates&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    NixOS Packages &amp;amp; Updates
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Installing packages on NixOS is quite different from other distributions. Instead of using a package manager directly, you add the packages you want to the &lt;code&gt;configuration.nix&lt;/code&gt; file and then run sudo nixos-rebuild switch. This command pulls the packages from the Nix store and applies the changes declaratively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Updating the system also differs from traditional distros. You run sudo nixos-rebuild switch &amp;ndash;upgrade, which compares versions and upgrades to the latest available packages accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This approach emphasizes a &lt;em&gt;declarative&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;reproducible&lt;/em&gt; system configuration, rather than manual package installs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;nixos-generations&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#nixos-generations&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    NixOS Generations
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long story short, every time the system state is rebuilt using &lt;code&gt;nixos-rebuild switch&lt;/code&gt;, a new &lt;a href=&#34;https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Overview_of_the_NixOS_Linux_distribution#Generations&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;generation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is created. You can revert to the previous generation at any time, which is useful if a configuration change (or system update) turns out to be detrimental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can quickly become overwhelming, particularly when dealing with the &lt;em&gt;bootloader&lt;/em&gt;. Accumulating over 100 generations isn&amp;rsquo;t ideal, which is why I&amp;rsquo;ve added an alias to my &lt;code&gt;.bashrc&lt;/code&gt; file. This alias automatically removes all old generations, keeping only the most recent one after I&amp;rsquo;ve confirmed its stability. Feel free to add it to your setup if you find it useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:6;-o-tab-size:6;tab-size:6;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;alias&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;ncg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f1fa8c&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;nix-collect-garbage --delete-old &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo nix-collect-garbage -d &amp;amp;&amp;amp; sudo /run/current-system/bin/switch-to-configuration boot&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h1 id=&#34;flakes--home-manager&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#flakes--home-manager&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Flakes &amp;amp; Home-Manager
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the get-go I decided I will never use &lt;a href=&#34;https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/index.xhtml#ch-introduction&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Home-Manager&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; thing. I do not like the ideology behind it. I want to keep it simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I am willing to go to the next level with something called &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Flakes&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flakes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Right now though, I am still at the beginning of my &lt;strong&gt;NixOS&lt;/strong&gt; adventure/challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;update-1&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#update-1&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Update 1
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After about &lt;strong&gt;2 weeks&lt;/strong&gt; of poking around and tweaking things, I finally felt chill enough to jump into the world of &lt;strong&gt;Flakes&lt;/strong&gt;. If I’m honest, the biggest reason was my growing obsession with &lt;strong&gt;Flatpaks&lt;/strong&gt;. I wanted a straightforward, &lt;em&gt;declarative&lt;/em&gt; way to install them, and &lt;strong&gt;Flakes&lt;/strong&gt; was basically my only escape hatch for making it happen. So, I finally crossed that line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/JGD3Bfp.png&#34; alt=&#34;XeroNix&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not a ton else has changed, you know how it goes with these setups, but I did have my own little victory: I managed to get &lt;strong&gt;Virt-Manager&lt;/strong&gt; all set up, with the networking actually working for once (which, if you know, you know how annoying that can be). It felt pretty nice pulling all these pieces together. There’s something satisfying about seeing everything actually work after a bunch of trial and error !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Access my &lt;strong&gt;Flakes&lt;/strong&gt; on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/DarkXero-dev/XeroNix&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XeroNix Repo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#conclusion&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Conclusion
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After two weeks of use, the system is fully functional for everyday activities like web browsing, watching movies, writing blog posts, and even gaming. I managed to set up &lt;strong&gt;Steam&lt;/strong&gt; and everything needed to enjoy my favorite games. Interestingly, the performance feels slightly better than on &lt;strong&gt;Arch&lt;/strong&gt;, which I find both surprising and impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still taking things slow and steady, moving forward at my own comfortable pace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wish me luck&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    The Good, The Bad &amp;amp; The Ugly
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with the &lt;strong&gt;Good&lt;/strong&gt;—DistroWatch is basically the reason a lot of distros get noticed at all. Without it, many would just be stuck in obscurity with hardly anyone hearing about them. For example, I credit some of the buzz around &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt; to this site. Plus, I like how they keep track of each distro’s release history so users can easily follow along with updates and changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for the &lt;strong&gt;Bad&lt;/strong&gt;—there’s a downside. The site isn’t really well-moderated. That means anyone can post whatever, true or not, and it just stays there. The admins don’t seem to verify or control what’s being said about distros. So you end up with stuff floating around that might be misleading or flat out wrong. Not cool, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, the &lt;strong&gt;Ugly&lt;/strong&gt;, which is the main reason I’m venting here. &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt; has been listed on &lt;strong&gt;DistroWatch&lt;/strong&gt; since 2022 and was gradually gaining traction. Then, when I had to step away due to burnout, they marked it as &lt;strong&gt;Discontinued&lt;/strong&gt; which hasn&amp;rsquo;t been correct for well over a year now. &lt;em&gt;No longer is, check update below&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;situation-update&#34; &gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    Situation Update
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since this post originally went up, the situation&amp;rsquo;s been sorted out. &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt; is back up and running, the links are fixed, and things are slowly getting back on track. Big shoutout to that one awesome person from the &lt;strong&gt;DistroWatch&lt;/strong&gt; team who made this possible (I won&amp;rsquo;t name names, but you know who you are—thank you!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to leave this post up because, honestly, some parts are still relevant. Other distro maintainers have shared similar experiences with me, both recently and in the past. Just wanted to keep you all in the loop about what&amp;rsquo;s happened since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to help us climb the &lt;em&gt;popularity ladder&lt;/em&gt; quicker or maybe even write a quick review, you can do that &lt;a href=&#34;https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=xero&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;right here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But just a heads up, don’t treat &lt;strong&gt;DistroWatch&lt;/strong&gt; as the ultimate measure of popularity. That site mainly sorts distros by downloads and page views, not by actual user numbers. Plus, nobody really knows if the reviewers actually use the distro for any meaningful amount of time before leaving a review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And hey, always take the info about any distro (not just ours) with a pinch of salt. Some of it’s spot on, some&amp;hellip; not so much. The only real way to know is to try it out yourself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know what you think of all this in the comments, I’d really love to hear your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading ❤️‍🔥🙏&lt;/p&gt;

    Introduction
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months, I’ve been getting asked the same questions again and again: What exactly is &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt;? And why is it locked behind a &lt;em&gt;donation wall&lt;/em&gt;? So, I figured it’s about time to clear things up once and for all with this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grab a seat and let’s dive in…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;xerolinux-goal&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#xerolinux-goal&#34;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt; is an &lt;em&gt;Arch-based&lt;/em&gt; Linux distro I built mainly for myself, to make installing Arch easier using &lt;a href=&#34;https://calamares.io&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calamares&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And the desktop environment? Well, it’s gotta be &lt;a href=&#34;https://kde.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KDE Plasma&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, obviously. At first, I went a bit overboard and packed in way too much bloat, kinda like &lt;em&gt;Garuda&lt;/em&gt;, which honestly wasn’t great. Here’s a video from the very first release so you can see just how rough it was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
      &lt;iframe allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen&#34; loading=&#34;eager&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/l8Z7fr79A8I?autoplay=0&amp;amp;controls=1&amp;amp;end=0&amp;amp;loop=0&amp;amp;mute=0&amp;amp;start=0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But over time, I kept trimming things down and optimizing until I had a solid base to build on. I didn’t want every possible piece of software included by default, just the key settings and system tweaks, the stuff that takes the longest to set up. By settings, I mean system optimizations and some &lt;em&gt;ricing&lt;/em&gt;. Why? Because my needs change all the time, and packing everything in would just blow up the ISO size too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What about drivers?” you might ask. Same deal. My hardware changes now and then, so including every driver under the sun wouldn’t make sense. Instead, I stick to the basics (&lt;em&gt;kernel drivers&lt;/em&gt;) up front, with options to add more as you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I started sharing the ISO with my close friends, they loved how stable, easy to install, and lightweight it was, so they pushed me to turn it into a proper distro available to everyone. I was hesitant at first, since that meant I’d be responsible for support, but eventually, I took the plunge.&lt;/p&gt;

    Benefits &amp;amp; Features
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike many distros packed with tons of features and apps, &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt; focuses on a smooth, easy installation and helping you learn &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.archlinux.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arch Linux&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; through the toolkit we provide. Check out the video below for a look:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
      &lt;iframe allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen&#34; loading=&#34;eager&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/YGSOthQbefI?autoplay=0&amp;amp;controls=1&amp;amp;end=0&amp;amp;loop=0&amp;amp;mute=0&amp;amp;start=0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The distro stays out of your way as much as possible and lets you build whatever setup you want, be it &lt;strong&gt;Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Content Creation&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Development&lt;/strong&gt; or any combination of all three. Instead of forcing apps or tools you might not want, we leave it all up to you, keeping things bloat-free. It’s the kind of distro that puts you in control. Need help or want to know more? We’re always here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;rise--fall&#34; &gt;

        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Rise &amp;amp; Fall
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Distro rose to become more popular than I had ever imagined, beating &lt;a href=&#34;https://endeavouros.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EndeavourOS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at one point on &lt;a href=&#34;https://distrowatch.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DistroWatch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as long as it was &lt;em&gt;Free&lt;/em&gt; and available that is.. Yes, my fellow readers, that was great and all but with every rise comes a hard fall. What I mean by that is, once I added a price tag, things took a hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gnome.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gnome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by popular demand brought new challenges on top of everything else&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;donation-wall&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#donation-wall&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Donation-Wall
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started taking on more for the project, like pumping out new versions, the costs just kept growing. Honestly, I’m one person out here in &lt;strong&gt;Lebanon&lt;/strong&gt;, and let’s just say it’s not exactly easy to find a solid job, so keeping things going got pretty tough. That’s why I had to step back for a bit and rethink everything. I even tried making it just a &lt;em&gt;post-install script&lt;/em&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Vanilla Arch&lt;/em&gt;, and that was okay for a while, but then people kept telling me to bring back the full distro, so I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But keeping things the same just wasn’t going to cut it if I wanted &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt; to survive. Then I noticed &lt;a href=&#34;https://archcraft.io/premium.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ArchCraft&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; doing their own thing, charging for &lt;em&gt;premium versions&lt;/em&gt;, and it made me think, “Hey, maybe I should try something similar.” That’s how the whole &lt;em&gt;donation wall&lt;/em&gt; idea was born. If you decide to chip in, you’re supporting the time and effort I put in, not just paying for an ISO. And relax—the code is still totally free; you can always grab it from &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/XeroLinuxDev/xero-build&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Github&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, fork it, tweak it, or do whatever you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now before you say it, I will, &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;But it&amp;rsquo;s not the same !&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rdquo;. Honestly, I get that it’s not exactly the same, hear me out. He gives out these free versions for people to mess around with, but let’s be real, it’s all a clever &lt;strong&gt;marketing move&lt;/strong&gt;. Pretty much every product out there has some kind of &lt;em&gt;free demo&lt;/em&gt; that’s designed to &lt;strong&gt;hook&lt;/strong&gt; you in. The whole point is to get you interested, so you’ll hopefully want to pay for the full or premium version later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt; doesn’t roll with the same kind of strategy because, honestly, it’s just too risky. Instead, it offers other ways to get pretty close results but not exactly the same, mostly through a bunch of handy &lt;a href=&#34;https://xerolinux.xyz/scripts/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;scripts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I put out there totally free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be wondering what I mean by &lt;em&gt;too risky&lt;/em&gt;, so here’s the deal: These scripts are powerful tools aimed mainly at folks comfortable with &lt;strong&gt;Arch Linux&lt;/strong&gt; and who know their way around the command line. They give you loads of flexibility and choice, but they’re not everyone&amp;rsquo;s cup of tea since they require some Linux know-how. So, rather than locking you into a &lt;em&gt;one-size-fits-all&lt;/em&gt; approach, I prefer giving you options, mostly for the &lt;em&gt;Linux geeks&lt;/em&gt; out there who want full control without the risk of breaking things unintentionally. If you’re more into clicking around in a GUI, no worries, you can always go with the distro itself or whatever suits your style. It’s really all about what you want to do and how deep you wanna dive into Linux fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I put out a free version of the distro, most people would probably just stick with it and skip any paid ones. There’s also no way to make a &lt;em&gt;limited&lt;/em&gt; free version that works right. From being part of the Linux community for a while, I’ve noticed that many people think &lt;em&gt;Free&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Free Open Source&lt;/em&gt; means free beer, which it doesn’t. It actually means you have the &lt;em&gt;freedom&lt;/em&gt; to use, modify, and share the software however you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why almost no one pays for such projects and we get attacked for charging for them. This has to stop or else projects will continue to fade away!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;wrap-up&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#wrap-up&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Wrap-Up
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright, let’s wrap things up!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I know &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt; might not pack as many flashy features as &lt;a href=&#34;https://cachyos.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CachyOS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or some of the other distros out there, but that was never really the goal. I wanted to make something different. If you’re not vibing with the vision behind the project, that’s totally cool, just use whatever distro works for you. No hard feelings, no judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truth is, if I ever get a little more financially secure, I swear I’ll ditch the price tag entirely and make XeroLinux free for everyone. For now though, this is my only source of income, and things are pretty tight. I just hope folks get where I’m coming from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huge thanks to everyone who’s stuck by the project—whether you’ve chipped in financially or donated your time. You’re the reason I’m able to keep this going, and I seriously appreciate every bit of support.

    Introduction
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months, I’ve been getting asked the same questions again and again: What exactly is &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt;? And why is it locked behind a &lt;em&gt;donation wall&lt;/em&gt;? So, I figured it’s about time to clear things up once and for all with this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grab a seat and let’s dive in…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;xerolinux-goal&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#xerolinux-goal&#34;&gt;

    XeroLinux Goal
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt; is an &lt;em&gt;Arch-based&lt;/em&gt; Linux distro I built mainly for myself, to make installing Arch easier using &lt;a href=&#34;https://calamares.io&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Calamares&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And the desktop environment? Well, it’s gotta be &lt;a href=&#34;https://kde.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KDE Plasma&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, obviously. At first, I went a bit overboard and packed in way too much bloat, kinda like &lt;em&gt;Garuda&lt;/em&gt;, which honestly wasn’t great. Here’s a video from the very first release so you can see just how rough it was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
      &lt;iframe allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen&#34; loading=&#34;eager&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/l8Z7fr79A8I?autoplay=0&amp;amp;controls=1&amp;amp;end=0&amp;amp;loop=0&amp;amp;mute=0&amp;amp;start=0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Honestly, I know &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt; might not pack as many flashy features as &lt;a href=&#34;https://cachyos.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CachyOS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or some of the other distros out there, but that was never really the goal. I wanted to make something different. If you’re not vibing with the vision behind the project, that’s totally cool, just use whatever distro works for you. No hard feelings, no judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Truth is, if I ever get a little more financially secure, I swear I’ll ditch the price tag entirely and make XeroLinux free for everyone. For now though, this is my only source of income, and things are pretty tight. I just hope folks get where I’m coming from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huge thanks to everyone who’s stuck by the project—whether you’ve chipped in financially or donated your time. You’re the reason I’m able to keep this going, and I seriously appreciate every bit of support. If you haven’t grabbed a copy yet or aren’t sure how to help out, check out the links below and see if there’s a way you’d like to jump in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also please let me know your thoughts in the comments below, tell me if you agree or disagree with the reasoning behind my actions. It&amp;rsquo;s ok if you don&amp;rsquo;t agree, I will not judge you, it&amp;rsquo;s a judgement-free zone over here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading. ❤️🔥🙏&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    Information
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt; has had 2 flavors for a while now, with a 3rd one coming. That being &lt;strong&gt;Gnome&lt;/strong&gt;. I have created that version due to what I thought was popular demand and because many do not like the way the &lt;strong&gt;KDE Plasma&lt;/strong&gt; devs do things, shoving features down our throats without doing much &lt;em&gt;bug-fixing&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/u5uXdJZ.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;Sales&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Gnome&lt;/strong&gt; version doesn&amp;rsquo;t have many tweaks applied to it simply because I wanted to be stable, having less reasons to break, and the point of it was and still is to stay out of your way so you can do what you wanna do without issue creeping in when least expected. I applied just enough making it more useable/functional than stock &lt;strong&gt;Gnome&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;stalemate&#34; &gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    Stalemate
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question am now asking myself is, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;What the heck happened ?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;. Yeah, coz it&amp;rsquo;s been months now, no one showing any interest in it. As you can see from the image below, only 20 people showed interest since it came out vs &lt;strong&gt;KDE&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rsquo;s 437. Why is that I wonder ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;text-align: center;&#34;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/bGIkm9C.png&#34; alt=&#34;Sales&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;price-or-what-&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#price-or-what-&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Price or what ?
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Could it be the price ? I mean it&amp;rsquo;s only $5 more than &lt;strong&gt;KDE&lt;/strong&gt;. Nothing too steep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason behind the price difference is very simple. Since I do not use &lt;strong&gt;Gnome&lt;/strong&gt; on the daily, I would have to do extra work to support it and make sure it keeps working as intended. Extra work means extra cost for me. Think about it this way, would you agree to put in extra hours at work for &lt;strong&gt;NO EXTRA PAY&lt;/strong&gt; ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I mean, it&amp;rsquo;s similar to over-time. Each extra hour you work you get extra &lt;strong&gt;$$$&lt;/strong&gt;, that&amp;rsquo;s how it normally is right ? Same here. I use &lt;strong&gt;KDE Plasma&lt;/strong&gt; on the daily, so it&amp;rsquo;s what I call &lt;em&gt;Normal 9 to 5 working day&lt;/em&gt;. As for &lt;strong&gt;Gnome&lt;/strong&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Over-Time&lt;/em&gt;, hence the extra $5. I hope this clarifies things. I want to offer choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;quality-&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#quality-&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Quality ?
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it&amp;rsquo;s not the price though, then what is it ? Is it the fact that it isn&amp;rsquo;t up to Quality expectations ? I mean I do not want it to be too bloated, or have reasons to break. Stability is what I aim for, not looks as I did with &lt;strong&gt;KDE&lt;/strong&gt;. Do you want more ? I am confused. Please do let me know in the comments below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;wrap-up&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#wrap-up&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Wrap-Up
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all that out of the way, I am eager to know what the situation is. Should I keep the &lt;strong&gt;Gnome&lt;/strong&gt; edition out there or not ? Would a &lt;strong&gt;Cosmic Spin&lt;/strong&gt; be worth my time to release once it reaches maturity ? I wonder&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please be vocal, without your voice I would be acting in total darkness, and deafness&amp;hellip; After all I am doing this for the community not myself. If I was, then only &lt;strong&gt;KDE&lt;/strong&gt; would exist nothing else..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks ❤️‍🔥 🙏&lt;/p&gt;

    Hello everyone,
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I need to share some of my thoughts and frustrations. If this isn&amp;rsquo;t your cup of tea, feel free to check out other posts. For those sticking around, thank you for lending an ear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing this post wasn&amp;rsquo;t easy; it took a lot of reflection and courage to open up about these feelings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S: This blog post reflects the thoughts and feelings of a passionate developer navigating the challenging world of FOSS and the struggle for financial stability. Your support and feedback are always appreciated. Now, let’s dive in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    My Frustration
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, I’ve been investing a lot of time and effort into my projects and contributing to &lt;strong&gt;FOSS&lt;/strong&gt; (Free and Open Source Software) wherever possible. While I find this work rewarding, it’s also been increasingly frustrating. Why? Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spend countless hours working behind the scenes to make everyone’s life easier. While there are a few of you who go above and beyond to support my work, and I am incredibly grateful for that, it’s disheartening to see so little engagement overall. Feedback is crucial for improvement, and without issue reports or suggestions, it&amp;rsquo;s challenging to know if I’m making a real impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;seeking-purpose&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#seeking-purpose&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Seeking Purpose
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, I embarked on this journey for fun and to learn new things. However, lately, I’ve been questioning the purpose behind my efforts. It feels like I’m stuck in a cycle of constant work with little to show for it. This isn’t about blaming anyone; it’s about seeking the motivation to keep going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;monetization-attempts&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#monetization-attempts&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Monetization Attempts
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As my financial situation became more strained, I reluctantly turned to monetization. Many advised me to turn my passion into a viable source of income. So, I tried implementing a &amp;ldquo;pay what you can&amp;rdquo; model, hoping it would help sustain my work. However, this didn’t go as planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;FOSS&lt;/strong&gt; community, known for its spirit of freedom, often struggles with the concept of financial support for free software. It’s a complex issue, and while some have been supportive, overall, the response hasn’t been enough to make a significant difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;health-concerns&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#health-concerns&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Health Concerns
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On top of these challenges, I have been dealing with significant health issues. Most notably, I have severe dental problems that require a full set of dentures. Not to forget other health issues like Sciatica, blood pressure and more. All this isn’t cheap, and without stable income, it’s been impossible to address. These health issues have affected my confidence and my ability to engage publicly, adding another layer of difficulty to my situation. Health must come before everything else, including fun and passion projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stress from these financial and health challenges has also taken a toll on my mental health. I&amp;rsquo;ve been experiencing frequent anxiety and panic attacks, and the constant pressure has led to a deep sense of depression. The overwhelming silence and lack of engagement have exacerbated these feelings, making it even harder to stay motivated and productive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-way-forward&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-way-forward&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    The Way Forward
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given these circumstances, I’m focusing more on my various projects and this blog. Writing provides a creative outlet that isn’t constrained by algorithms or view counts. I will freely share what I can, not everything. I am currently spending more than the income am getting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main priority now is finding ways to support my financial needs. If and when I achieve that stability, I plan to return to my passion projects with renewed energy and many new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;closing-thoughts&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#closing-thoughts&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Closing Thoughts
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to those of you who continue to support my work. Your appreciation means the world to me and keeps me going even when things get tough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, I need to prioritize my well-being and financial stability. Once those are in place, I’ll be back with future projects. Right now, I’m dealing with depression, anxiety, and panic attacks due to my job situation and need time to recover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for understanding and supporting me through this journey.&lt;/p&gt;

Health must come before everything else, including fun and passion projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stress from these financial and health challenges has also taken a toll on my mental health. I&amp;rsquo;ve been experiencing frequent anxiety and panic attacks, and the constant pressure has led to a deep sense of depression. The overwhelming silence and lack of engagement have exacerbated these feelings, making it even harder to stay motivated and productive.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    The Way Forward
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given these circumstances, I’m focusing more on my various projects and this blog. Writing provides a creative outlet that isn’t constrained by algorithms or view counts. I will freely share what I can, not everything. I am currently spending more than the income am getting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My main priority now is finding ways to support my financial needs. If and when I achieve that stability, I plan to return to my passion projects with renewed energy and many new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    Closing Thoughts
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to those of you who continue to support my work. Your appreciation means the world to me and keeps me going even when things get tough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, I need to prioritize my well-being and financial stability. Once those are in place, I’ll be back with future projects. Right now, I’m dealing with depression, anxiety, and panic attacks due to my job situation and need time to recover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for understanding and supporting me through this journey.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    Am I a Developer ?
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lol, yeah, I know—it&amp;rsquo;s a question I get a lot. But in my humble opinion, no, I am not. Far from it. I&amp;rsquo;m just a guy who, at most, messes with code—specifically &lt;strong&gt;Bash&lt;/strong&gt;. I take what I understand, put it together in a way that makes sense (to me at least), and hope it works. That&amp;rsquo;s all I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
      &lt;iframe allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen&#34; loading=&#34;eager&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/8_K-NOu-STs?autoplay=0&amp;amp;controls=1&amp;amp;end=0&amp;amp;loop=0&amp;amp;mute=0&amp;amp;start=0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if it does work, I&amp;rsquo;m happy and share the result with the &lt;strong&gt;FOSS&lt;/strong&gt; community.&lt;/p&gt;

    It&amp;rsquo;s fun until&amp;hellip;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doing this is super fun and fulfilling—until I hit a brick wall, stop getting new ideas, or can&amp;rsquo;t find a solution to what I&amp;rsquo;m trying to accomplish. Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s super frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, I know I can reach out to the &lt;strong&gt;FOSS&lt;/strong&gt; community for help. However, not all of it is sunshine and roses. I try, but I often get more frustrated with the differences of opinion out there. No matter how much I try to satisfy some requests, I can&amp;rsquo;t do it for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I run into some elitists who think their opinion is the only one that matters. I always make the mistake of replying to them when it&amp;rsquo;s better to ignore them. Yes, those types of people exist everywhere—not just in &lt;strong&gt;FOSS&lt;/strong&gt;. But alas, that&amp;rsquo;s where we feel it the most, especially when we try to monetize our work. But I already discussed that in another post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, once a project is complete, the feeling of accomplishment is so rewarding, lol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the part where I say: please, don&amp;rsquo;t keep your work to yourself. Share it with the community—who knows, maybe you&amp;rsquo;ll find someone who can help take your project to another level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to keep stuff to myself until I began sharing. That&amp;rsquo;s when everything took off, and I was able to help others. If it&amp;rsquo;s not a project, maybe it&amp;rsquo;s the knowledge you&amp;rsquo;ve gained. Share it by helping others when and where you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Sharing is caring,&amp;rdquo; as the saying goes. Anyway, I hope this post was a good read. Enjoy! ;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#in-memoriam&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    In Memoriam
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is with a heavy heart that I share the passing of &lt;strong&gt;GamerKing&lt;/strong&gt;, a remarkable 19-year-old from my region who lived only 20 minutes away. He was not only a brilliant &lt;strong&gt;Linux&lt;/strong&gt; enthusiast but also a vibrant soul who played a significant role in shaping the future of &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt;. His relentless pursuit of perfection and attention to detail, particularly when it came to consistency, pushed the project to heights it would never have reached without his insightful input.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/37Ew8GN.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;gk&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will admit, there were times when I disagreed with his ideas, but his persistence, backed by reason and logic, often changed my mind. &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt; carries his imprint, and his contributions will forever be woven into its fabric. In a place like &lt;strong&gt;Lebanon&lt;/strong&gt;, where &lt;strong&gt;Linux&lt;/strong&gt; is a rarity, he stood out as a true gem, his knowledge far surpassing that of most people in our country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For over a year, our country has been engulfed in a conflict, one that escalated into tragic proportions in the last few weeks. It began as a high-tech war, with explosive devices disguised as everyday objects like pagers and walkie-talkies. The violence claimed many lives, and &lt;strong&gt;GamerKing&lt;/strong&gt; was caught in the crossfire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, as of the writing of this post, his neighborhood was hit for the first time, and he suffered severe injuries, losing a significant amount of blood. From his hospital bed, he reached out to me, recounting the terrifying events. The details of his condition were harrowing, but he maintained his characteristic humor, and we joked about the situation, as we often did. It was a brief, bittersweet exchange, and when we said our goodbyes, I was reassured that he would recover. I had no idea it would be the last time we spoke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the conflict worsened, bombings crept closer to both of us. I assumed he was resting and chose not to disturb him, unaware of the devastation that was to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-loss&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#the-loss&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    The Loss
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, as I write this, a massive bombing destroyed a six-building complex near &lt;strong&gt;GamerKing&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rsquo;s location. Soon after, I received a message from his younger brother. At first, I believed it was &lt;strong&gt;GamerKing&lt;/strong&gt; himself, and my immediate question was, &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Are you OK?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; But the reply came from his brother, who, after a moment of silence, shared the heartbreaking news: &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;He told me that if anything happened to me, open Discord and tell Dark&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;rdquo; I asked, trembling, &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;Why? What happened?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo; After what felt like an eternity, he delivered the words that shattered my world: &amp;ldquo;&lt;strong&gt;He just left us&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still don’t know what took him from us, whether it was his injuries or the bombing—but the tragic truth remains: I have lost a dear friend, a colleague, and one of the brightest individuals I have ever had the privilege to know. The shock of his passing has yet to settle in, and I fear it never truly will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will always remember his infectious energy, his humor, and his brilliance. He was the light of &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt;, and his absence will be deeply felt. Please join me in mourning the loss of a truly exceptional man. &lt;strong&gt;Rest in peace, little brother&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;#whats-this&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    What&amp;rsquo;s This?
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, after reflecting on my activities and our collective behavior as Linux users, I realized a few things I wanted to share. This post doesn&amp;rsquo;t belong on the main site but here, where I can speak candidly about how things have been and how we, as so-called Linux users, often behave. I&amp;rsquo;m as guilty as anyone else, so let&amp;rsquo;s sit back, relax, grab a cup of coffee or a bottle of beer, and read on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;content-creators&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#content-creators&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Content Creators
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before diving in, I want to clarify that I am not a content creator. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried many times and failed miserably, so I don&amp;rsquo;t include myself in this group for now. However, I need to address the challenges they face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube content creators (CCs) do a thankless job. It&amp;rsquo;s incredibly hard work, requiring meticulous planning, high-quality equipment, and, above all, an enormous amount of patience. Unfortunately, the comment sections are often filled with toxic trash talk, which can be demoralizing. Reading these negative comments can lead to feelings of depression and inadequacy, making creators feel they are not meeting viewer expectations. This is far from the truth; the reality is that satisfying everyone is impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content creators invest significant time, money, and energy into producing videos that inform, entertain, and educate. Their efforts are crucial for enhancing our understanding and enjoyment of various topics. Even writers like myself sometimes rely on their videos to illustrate points or tools we discuss in our posts. Blog posts and YouTube videos complement each other, making our content more engaging and informative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;writers--blog-posters&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#writers--blog-posters&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Writers / Blog Posters
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where I include myself. We do our best to bring you high-quality content. We strive to be as unbiased as possible, but mistakes happen. We are human and sometimes say the wrong things out of frustration, but that&amp;rsquo;s no excuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One common mistake we make is not doing enough research before posting. This can lead to a lack of primary sources to back up our claims, which makes our posts less trustworthy. Recently, it was brought to my attention that I was guilty of this. Instead of pushing away constructive criticism, I embraced it and made sure to do better. Thanks to a user on Discord, I’ve learned to improve, and I thank them for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;appreciating-ccs-and-writers&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#appreciating-ccs-and-writers&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Appreciating CCs and Writers
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often overlook the effort and dedication that content creators and writers put into their work. From brainstorming ideas to scripting, filming, editing, and publishing, every step requires significant effort and attention to detail. They often juggle these tasks alongside their personal and professional lives, making their commitment even more commendable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both content creators and writers face the challenge of staying updated with the latest trends, technologies, and viewer preferences. This constant evolution demands flexibility and a willingness to learn and adapt. Despite these challenges, many persist, driven by their passion and dedication to their craft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As writers and bloggers, we pour our hearts into our work, aiming to provide valuable insights and information. We strive to deliver accurate and engaging content, but we are not infallible. Constructive feedback helps us grow and improve, enabling us to produce better content for our readers. It&amp;rsquo;s essential to recognize that writing is an iterative process. Each piece we publish is a step toward improvement. Constructive criticism, when offered kindly and thoughtfully, is a valuable tool that helps us refine our skills and enhance the quality of our work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;fostering-a-positive-community&#34; &gt;

        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Fostering a Positive Community
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The F.O.S.S. Linux community thrives on collaboration and mutual support. By fostering a positive and inclusive environment, we can attract more people and encourage contributions. Let&amp;rsquo;s move away from harsh judgments and toward constructive dialogues that promote growth and understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we encounter content we don&amp;rsquo;t agree with, let&amp;rsquo;s engage in respectful discussions. Share your perspectives, offer suggestions, and be open to different viewpoints. This approach enriches our community and helps content creators and writers deliver better content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of judging writers and content creators harshly, provide constructive criticism and exchange ideas to help us improve and bring you more useful content. Many of us, myself included, have been guilty of negativity. This message serves as a reminder to be more supportive. Let&amp;rsquo;s help each other grow in the F.O.S.S. Linux community and attract more people by discussing and recommending content thoughtfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

    What&amp;rsquo;s This?
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, after reflecting on my activities and our collective behavior as Linux users, I realized a few things I wanted to share. This post doesn&amp;rsquo;t belong on the main site but here, where I can speak candidly about how things have been and how we, as so-called Linux users, often behave. I&amp;rsquo;m as guilty as anyone else, so let&amp;rsquo;s sit back, relax, grab a cup of coffee or a bottle of beer, and read on.&lt;/p&gt;

    Content Creators
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before diving in, I want to clarify that I am not a content creator. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried many times and failed miserably, so I don&amp;rsquo;t include myself in this group for now. However, I need to address the challenges they face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YouTube content creators (CCs) do a thankless job. It&amp;rsquo;s incredibly hard work, requiring meticulous planning, high-quality equipment, and, above all, an enormous amount of patience. Unfortunately, the comment sections are often filled with toxic trash talk, which can be demoralizing. Reading these negative comments can lead to feelings of depression and inadequacy, making creators feel they are not meeting viewer expectations. This is far from the truth; the reality is that satisfying everyone is impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content creators invest significant time, money, and energy into producing videos that inform, entertain, and educate. Their efforts are crucial for enhancing our understanding and enjoyment of various topics. Even writers like myself sometimes rely on their videos to illustrate points or tools we discuss in our posts. Blog posts and YouTube videos complement each other, making our content more engaging and informative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;writers--blog-posters&#34; &gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    Writers / Blog Posters
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where I include myself. We do our best to bring you high-quality content. We strive to be as unbiased as possible, but mistakes happen. We are human and sometimes say the wrong things out of frustration, but that&amp;rsquo;s no excuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One common mistake we make is not doing enough research before posting. This can lead to a lack of primary sources to back up our claims, which makes our posts less trustworthy. Recently, it was brought to my attention that I was guilty of this. Instead of pushing away constructive criticism, I embraced it and made sure to do better. Thanks to a user on Discord, I’ve learned to improve, and I thank them for that.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    Appreciating CCs and Writers
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We often overlook the effort and dedication that content creators and writers put into their work. From brainstorming ideas to scripting, filming, editing, and publishing, every step requires significant effort and attention to detail. They often juggle these tasks alongside their personal and professional lives, making their commitment even more commendable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both content creators and writers face the challenge of staying updated with the latest trends, technologies, and viewer preferences. This constant evolution demands flexibility and a willingness to learn and adapt. Despite these challenges, many persist, driven by their passion and dedication to their craft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As writers and bloggers, we pour our hearts into our work, aiming to provide valuable insights and information. We strive to deliver accurate and engaging content, but we are not infallible. Constructive feedback helps us grow and improve, enabling us to produce better content for our readers. It&amp;rsquo;s essential to recognize that writing is an iterative process. Each piece we publish is a step toward improvement. Constructive criticism, when offered kindly and thoughtfully, is a valuable tool that helps us refine our skills and enhance the quality of our work.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    Fostering a Positive Community
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The F.O.S.S. Linux community thrives on collaboration and mutual support. By fostering a positive and inclusive environment, we can attract more people and encourage contributions. Let&amp;rsquo;s move away from harsh judgments and toward constructive dialogues that promote growth and understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we encounter content we don&amp;rsquo;t agree with, let&amp;rsquo;s engage in respectful discussions. Share your perspectives, offer suggestions, and be open to different viewpoints. This approach enriches our community and helps content creators and writers deliver better content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of judging writers and content creators harshly, provide constructive criticism and exchange ideas to help us improve and bring you more useful content. Many of us, myself included, have been guilty of negativity. This message serves as a reminder to be more supportive. Let&amp;rsquo;s help each other grow in the F.O.S.S. Linux community and attract more people by discussing and recommending content thoughtfully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading. I wanted to share my thoughts and recommendations in hopes of making the Linux community a more positive and welcoming place, free from negativity and elitism.

&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name’s &lt;strong&gt;Steve&lt;/strong&gt;, A.K.A &lt;strong&gt;TechXero/DarkXero&lt;/strong&gt;, and I am a 45 year old Tech fanatic from &lt;strong&gt;Lebanon&lt;/strong&gt;. I love technology, mainly Computer Hardware/Software, smartphones, and &lt;strong&gt;Linux&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;I currently maintain my very own &lt;i&gt;ArchLinux Toolkik/Distro&lt;/i&gt; &lt;strong&gt;XeroLinux&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am an avid &lt;strong&gt;iOS&lt;/strong&gt; user when it comes to smartphones. I did use &lt;strong&gt;Android&lt;/strong&gt; for 5 years, was happy on it for a while, I moved to &lt;strong&gt;iOS&lt;/strong&gt; and have been a happy man ever since. However, it’s not to say that I will stick with it for good, who knows what the future holds? I might go back to &lt;strong&gt;Android&lt;/strong&gt;.. I use both in parallel now see where I will land…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than that, I do freelance as a &lt;strong&gt;Technical Support specialist&lt;/strong&gt; from time to time. I have landed a Job at &lt;strong&gt;Apple&lt;/strong&gt; in 2019, in &lt;strong&gt;Ireland&lt;/strong&gt;. But it didn’t last long unfortunately, can’t go into detail as to why, but at least I can say that I have worked for that company LoL… I am currently unemployed, but it’s OK. I do get by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share this explanation about &lt;strong&gt;Linux&lt;/strong&gt; a good friend and fellow Linux enthusiast &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/REALERvolker1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REALERvolker1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; recently posted on &lt;strong&gt;Discord&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-is-linux-&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-linux-&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    What is Linux ?
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since not everyone&amp;rsquo;s super familiar with Linux, here&amp;rsquo;s a quick crash course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_kernel#:~:text=A%20monolithic%20kernel%20is%20an,virtual%20interface%20over%20computer%20hardware.&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monolithic Kernel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so all the drivers and whatnot are compiled into the binary. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nonfree software&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is usually put in the actual source repo as binary blobs, or in the case of &lt;strong&gt;nVidia&lt;/strong&gt; drivers, built using a system called &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Kernel_Module_Support&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DKMS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and compiled into the kernel binary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the computer boots up, an init process is started (the default is &lt;code&gt;/sbin/init&lt;/code&gt;, usually a symlink to your init system), which is &lt;code&gt;PID 1&lt;/code&gt;. This is when userspace is initialized. Due to security concerns and whatnot, you are restricted from having &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; much fun in userspace, so you need to ask the kernel to read files and allocate memory for you using syscalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyways, init starts all the userspace stuff (it itself is run in userspace) and this keeps the system secure. Since Linux is monolithic, you can&amp;rsquo;t just throw a malicious library into kernel space at runtime somehow, you have to compile it in. Anyways, Linux is a lot like Unix, with one notable difference being that Linux Is Not UniX. This means it uses the typical Unixy way of doing things like restricting access based on users and groups, being &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;POSIX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; compliant, and not really caring about file extensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;img width=&#34;600&#34; src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/Mu7NHx9.png&#34; alt=&#34;logo&#34;&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;distros--pkg-managers&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#distros--pkg-managers&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Distros &amp;amp; PKG Managers
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.debian.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debian&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you install packages with &lt;code&gt;apt&lt;/code&gt;. If you can&amp;rsquo;t remember the package name you want, you can use apt to search for it, or use synaptic as a &lt;em&gt;GUI&lt;/em&gt; frontend. If your desktop environment comes with one, you can use theirs, as that one should be easier to use, while still providing the exact same functionality. You don&amp;rsquo;t install programs by downloading them from the internet. If you have any questions, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.debian.org/DontBreakDebian&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debian Wiki&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is pretty mid, but the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.archlinux.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arch Wiki&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;a href=&#34;https://archlinux.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arch Linux&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; aims to be the most generic &lt;em&gt;Linux distro&lt;/em&gt; ever, information written for it should also help with &lt;strong&gt;Debian&lt;/strong&gt;, as long as the Arch package didn&amp;rsquo;t receive significant updates in the meantime. There are other ways to install software, like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flatpak:&lt;/strong&gt; Sandboxed apps that &amp;ldquo;just work&amp;rdquo; on every distribution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Snap:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s sandboxed apps that are supposed to work on every distribution but have had mixed results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AppImages:&lt;/strong&gt; These are like &lt;code&gt;.exe&lt;/code&gt; files on &lt;strong&gt;Windows&lt;/strong&gt;, but they require adding executable permissions and manually launching them. They also won&amp;rsquo;t have a desktop entry by default.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;filesystem--updates&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#filesystem--updates&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Filesystem &amp;amp; Updates
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you connect your system to the internet, you should update it at least once a week to protect against known vulnerabilities. If you&amp;rsquo;re not connected to the internet, you can choose whether to update or not—it might fix a bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the filesystem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/etc&lt;/code&gt; is where your Editable Text Configurations go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/usr&lt;/code&gt; is where program files go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/usr/local&lt;/code&gt; is where program files go for programs you manually installed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/home&lt;/code&gt; is where your personal files go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/dev&lt;/code&gt; is for device files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;D&lt;/code&gt; drive; instead, you mount external drives to a location, like &lt;code&gt;/mnt&lt;/code&gt;. A GUI file manager mounts flash drives somewhere in &lt;code&gt;/run&lt;/code&gt; since it is temporary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/opt&lt;/code&gt; is where miscellaneous stuff goes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/var&lt;/code&gt; is for variable data like system logs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/tmp&lt;/code&gt; is for temporary files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/dev/null&lt;/code&gt; is a &amp;ldquo;black hole&amp;rdquo; for data you want to discard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/dev/urandom&lt;/code&gt; is an IO-based random number generator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UNIX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,  everything is a file. This means you can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See process details by reading files in &lt;code&gt;/proc&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check system settings or driver configurations in &lt;code&gt;/sys&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;View your bootloader in &lt;code&gt;/boot&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    Wrapping it all up
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a quick run-through explaining what &lt;strong&gt;GNU/Linux&lt;/strong&gt; is written is, written as mentioned earlier by a good friend. I did not post it on the main site simply because I feel it&amp;rsquo;s not as complete as I would like it to be.&lt;/p&gt;

    Distros &amp;amp; PKG Managers
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.debian.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debian&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you install packages with &lt;code&gt;apt&lt;/code&gt;. If you can&amp;rsquo;t remember the package name you want, you can use apt to search for it, or use synaptic as a &lt;em&gt;GUI&lt;/em&gt; frontend. If your desktop environment comes with one, you can use theirs, as that one should be easier to use, while still providing the exact same functionality. You don&amp;rsquo;t install programs by downloading them from the internet. If you have any questions, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.debian.org/DontBreakDebian&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debian Wiki&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is pretty mid, but the &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.archlinux.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arch Wiki&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is amazing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;a href=&#34;https://archlinux.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arch Linux&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; aims to be the most generic &lt;em&gt;Linux distro&lt;/em&gt; ever, information written for it should also help with &lt;strong&gt;Debian&lt;/strong&gt;, as long as the Arch package didn&amp;rsquo;t receive significant updates in the meantime. There are other ways to install software, like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flatpak:&lt;/strong&gt; Sandboxed apps that &amp;ldquo;just work&amp;rdquo; on every distribution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Snap:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s sandboxed apps that are supposed to work on every distribution but have had mixed results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AppImages:&lt;/strong&gt; These are like &lt;code&gt;.exe&lt;/code&gt; files on &lt;strong&gt;Windows&lt;/strong&gt;, but they require adding executable permissions and manually launching them. They also won&amp;rsquo;t have a desktop entry by default.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;filesystem--updates&#34; &gt;
&lt;div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;#filesystem--updates&#34;&gt;
        ##
    &lt;/a&gt;
    Filesystem &amp;amp; Updates
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you connect your system to the internet, you should update it at least once a week to protect against known vulnerabilities. If you&amp;rsquo;re not connected to the internet, you can choose whether to update or not—it might fix a bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the filesystem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/etc&lt;/code&gt; is where your Editable Text Configurations go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/usr&lt;/code&gt; is where program files go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/usr/local&lt;/code&gt; is where program files go for programs you manually installed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/home&lt;/code&gt; is where your personal files go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/dev&lt;/code&gt; is for device files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no &lt;code&gt;C&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;D&lt;/code&gt; drive; instead, you mount external drives to a location, like &lt;code&gt;/mnt&lt;/code&gt;. A GUI file manager mounts flash drives somewhere in &lt;code&gt;/run&lt;/code&gt; since it is temporary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/opt&lt;/code&gt; is where miscellaneous stuff goes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/var&lt;/code&gt; is for variable data like system logs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/tmp&lt;/code&gt; is for temporary files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/dev/null&lt;/code&gt; is a &amp;ldquo;black hole&amp;rdquo; for data you want to discard.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/dev/urandom&lt;/code&gt; is an IO-based random number generator.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UNIX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,  everything is a file. This means you can:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See process details by reading files in &lt;code&gt;/proc&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check system settings or driver configurations in &lt;code&gt;/sys&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;View your bootloader in &lt;code&gt;/boot&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    Wrapping it all up
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a quick run-through explaining what &lt;strong&gt;GNU/Linux&lt;/strong&gt; is written is, written as mentioned earlier by a good friend. I did not post it on the main site simply because I feel it&amp;rsquo;s not as complete as I would like it to be.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    What&amp;rsquo;s This?
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This for my own use. Use it if you want to. Just documenting the installation of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mkdocs.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MKDocs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the way that works for me. You are free to go over this and take from it what suites you the best. Please do not ask me for help, it&amp;rsquo;s all there on their site. Also this for &lt;strong&gt;ArchLinux&lt;/strong&gt; if you don&amp;rsquo;t use that distro, well, their site shows how to install for your distro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
      &lt;iframe allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen&#34; loading=&#34;eager&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/9V0NpLPXS-Y?autoplay=0&amp;amp;controls=1&amp;amp;end=0&amp;amp;loop=0&amp;amp;mute=0&amp;amp;start=0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    Installing MKDocs
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will need to install it with some extras. The 2 main packages exist on the &lt;strong&gt;Arch&lt;/strong&gt; repos. The rest are on the &lt;strong&gt;AUR&lt;/strong&gt;, so to grab everything in one go, I will be using &lt;strong&gt;Paru&lt;/strong&gt;. Compiling might take a while, so sit back wile it finishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:6;-o-tab-size:6;tab-size:6;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-Bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;Bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;paru -S --noconfirm mkdocs mkdocs-get-deps mkdocs-material python-pipx python-pillow python-cairosvg mkdocs-material-extensions python-regex pymdown-extensions mkdocs-material-pymdownx-extras
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donce that&amp;rsquo;s done we need to create the site. There&amp;rsquo;s a command for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:6;-o-tab-size:6;tab-size:6;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-Bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;Bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;mkdocs new my-project
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; my-project
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we initialized the new site we need to configure it. We do so by editing the &lt;code&gt;mkdocs.yml&lt;/code&gt; file putting in the following info :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:6;-o-tab-size:6;tab-size:6;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-YAML&#34; data-lang=&#34;YAML&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;site_name&lt;/span&gt;: Sitename
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;theme&lt;/span&gt;:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;: material
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;logo&lt;/span&gt;: assets/Tux.gif
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;favicon&lt;/span&gt;: assets/favicon.ico
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;palette&lt;/span&gt;:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;scheme&lt;/span&gt;: slate
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;primary&lt;/span&gt;: deep purple
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;features&lt;/span&gt;:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;   - navigation.top
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;   - navigation.footer
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;   - navigation.indexes
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;   - content.code.copy
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;   - search.suggest
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;   - search.highlight
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;   - search.share
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;   - navigation.expand
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will make it use the &lt;strong&gt;Slate Material&lt;/strong&gt; Theme with &lt;strong&gt;Deep Purple&lt;/strong&gt; accents. To know more about the theme check the &lt;a href=&#34;https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MKDocs Material Wiki&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That&amp;rsquo;s it go from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have found a few that I liked on the &lt;strong&gt;AUR&lt;/strong&gt;, let&amp;rsquo;s install them via :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:6;-o-tab-size:6;tab-size:6;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-Bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;Bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;paru -S --noconfirm mkdocs-rss-plugin mkdocs-video mkdocs-autorefs mkdocs-section-index mkdocs-glightbox mkdocs-backlinks-plugin mkdocs-redirects mkdocs-ezlinks-plugin mkdocs-literate-nav mkdocs-macros-plugin
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To activate them we edit the same &lt;code&gt;mkdocs.yml&lt;/code&gt; file as before like so :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:6;-o-tab-size:6;tab-size:6;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-YAML&#34; data-lang=&#34;YAML&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;plugins&lt;/span&gt;:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  - rss
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  - social
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  - search
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  - autorefs
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  - glightbox
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some cool features we can enable too. Only gotta figure out why some are not working. Besides that, this is how we add them :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:6;-o-tab-size:6;tab-size:6;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-YAML&#34; data-lang=&#34;YAML&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;markdown_extensions&lt;/span&gt;:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;   - attr_list
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;   - def_list
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;   - footnotes
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;   - md_in_html
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;   - &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;toc&lt;/span&gt;:

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it for now. I will be updating this post as I learn more. Still need to figure out a few things. I am just starting with this.

    &lt;/a&gt;
    What&amp;rsquo;s This?
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This for my own use. Use it if you want to. Just documenting the installation of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mkdocs.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MKDocs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the way that works for me. You are free to go over this and take from it what suites you the best. Please do not ask me for help, it&amp;rsquo;s all there on their site. Also this for &lt;strong&gt;ArchLinux&lt;/strong&gt; if you don&amp;rsquo;t use that distro, well, their site shows how to install for your distro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
      &lt;iframe allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share; fullscreen&#34; loading=&#34;eager&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/9V0NpLPXS-Y?autoplay=0&amp;amp;controls=1&amp;amp;end=0&amp;amp;loop=0&amp;amp;mute=0&amp;amp;start=0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

    Installing MKDocs
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will need to install it with some extras. The 2 main packages exist on the &lt;strong&gt;Arch&lt;/strong&gt; repos. The rest are on the &lt;strong&gt;AUR&lt;/strong&gt;, so to grab everything in one go, I will be using &lt;strong&gt;Paru&lt;/strong&gt;. Compiling might take a while, so sit back wile it finishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:6;-o-tab-size:6;tab-size:6;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-Bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;Bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;paru -S --noconfirm mkdocs mkdocs-get-deps mkdocs-material python-pipx python-pillow python-cairosvg mkdocs-material-extensions python-regex pymdown-extensions mkdocs-material-pymdownx-extras
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donce that&amp;rsquo;s done we need to create the site. There&amp;rsquo;s a command for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:6;-o-tab-size:6;tab-size:6;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-Bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;Bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;mkdocs new my-project
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#8be9fd;font-style:italic&#34;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; my-project
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that we initialized the new site we need to configure it. We do so by editing the &lt;code&gt;mkdocs.yml&lt;/code&gt; file putting in the following info :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:6;-o-tab-size:6;tab-size:6;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-YAML&#34; data-lang=&#34;YAML&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;site_name&lt;/span&gt;: Sitename
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;theme&lt;/span&gt;:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;: material
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;logo&lt;/span&gt;: assets/Tux.gif
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;favicon&lt;/span&gt;: assets/favicon.ico
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;palette&lt;/span&gt;:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;scheme&lt;/span&gt;: slate
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;primary&lt;/span&gt;: deep purple
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;features&lt;/span&gt;:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;   - navigation.top
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;   - navigation.footer
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;   - navigation.indexes
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;   - content.code.copy
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;   - search.suggest
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;   - search.highlight
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;   - search.share
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;   - navigation.expand
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This will make it use the &lt;strong&gt;Slate Material&lt;/strong&gt; Theme with &lt;strong&gt;Deep Purple&lt;/strong&gt; accents. To know more about the theme check the &lt;a href=&#34;https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener noreferrer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MKDocs Material Wiki&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That&amp;rsquo;s it go from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have found a few that I liked on the &lt;strong&gt;AUR&lt;/strong&gt;, let&amp;rsquo;s install them via :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:6;-o-tab-size:6;tab-size:6;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-Bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;Bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;paru -S --noconfirm mkdocs-rss-plugin mkdocs-video mkdocs-autorefs mkdocs-section-index mkdocs-glightbox mkdocs-backlinks-plugin mkdocs-redirects mkdocs-ezlinks-plugin mkdocs-literate-nav mkdocs-macros-plugin
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;To activate them we edit the same &lt;code&gt;mkdocs.yml&lt;/code&gt; file as before like so :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:6;-o-tab-size:6;tab-size:6;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-YAML&#34; data-lang=&#34;YAML&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;plugins&lt;/span&gt;:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  - rss
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  - social
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  - search
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  - autorefs
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  - glightbox
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some cool features we can enable too. Only gotta figure out why some are not working. Besides that, this is how we add them :&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:6;-o-tab-size:6;tab-size:6;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-YAML&#34; data-lang=&#34;YAML&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ff79c6&#34;&gt;markdown_extensions&lt;/span&gt;:
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#6272a4&#34;&gt;# Python Markdown&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;   - abbr
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;   - admonition

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;   - def_list
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;   - footnotes
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;   - md_in_html

&lt;p&gt;I have lost my root pass on &lt;strong&gt;Linux&lt;/strong&gt; more times than I can count. This guide is here so I do not have to &lt;em&gt;Google&lt;/em&gt; it lol. Might be useful to you I dunno. But it&amp;rsquo;s here.&lt;/p&gt;

    Let&amp;rsquo;s do this 🚀
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How to reset forgotten root password in a &lt;strong&gt;GNU/Linux&lt;/strong&gt; distribution with &lt;code&gt;GRUB&lt;/code&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is a laptop or a desktop which you have next to you then follow these steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shut down the device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Start it again. When you see GRUB menu, press the &lt;code&gt;e&lt;/code&gt; key on the keyboard before the system starts booting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the &lt;code&gt;GRUB&lt;/code&gt; boot options, scroll down and locate the line that begins with &lt;code&gt;linux&lt;/code&gt;. In this line move the cursor to the end, right after &lt;code&gt;ro quiet&lt;/code&gt;. Delete everything after that. Change &lt;code&gt;ro&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;rw&lt;/code&gt;. Append the parameter &lt;code&gt;init=/bin/bash&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press Ctrl+x, or F10, to boot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will see a root prompt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:6;-o-tab-size:6;tab-size:6;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-Bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;Bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;:#
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remount the filesystem in read/write mode:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ol start=&#34;6&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set the password of any user(s).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:6;-o-tab-size:6;tab-size:6;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-Bash&#34; data-lang=&#34;Bash&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;:# passwd joe
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ol start=&#34;7&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reboot with the command &lt;code&gt;reboot -f&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s it ! The new password should work now.&lt;/p&gt;
