### The Toolkit.

This toolkit aims to be an _all-in-one_ solution for post-installation, expediting your Arch setup. Please head on over to toolkit's **Github** linked below and check out the [**Wiki**](https://github.com/xerolinux/xlapit-cli/wiki) for more detailed information.

> It's crucial to clarify that this toolkit isn't intended for custom Arch-Based distros. While some elements might function, I can't ensure seamless compatibility due to potential conflicts arising from differing tweaks and repositories. To ensure optimal performance, it's strongly recommended for use on a clean Pure-Arch install executed through the ArchInstall script. Nor will it provide Arch or DE/WM installations.

### Xero-Layan Rice

It's the best **KDE** rice I have ever created, in my opinion. If you want to enjoy said rice on your system, feel free to teleport to **Github** linked below and have fun. ðŸ˜€

> I would like to clarify one very important aspect of ricing. We use custom themes, and those might not get updated very often, if at all by their respective developers/artists, which might result in some parts of the system and apps not to get themed correctly. That, my friends, is unfortunately out of our hands.

### Xero-Plasma Install Script

With the help of this script you will be able to install **Plasma** in one of 4 methods as you can see in the image below. So feel free to teleport to **Github** linked below to see how use this script. And let me know what you think.

> This script has an option to include my repo & Toolkit. Toolkit also includes option to apply my rice. So if you opt to include it, you do not need to get other projects/tools separately. It's meant as an All-in-One solution.

### Wrapping up

While my tools are great and offer amazing flexibility and total freedom of choice, they are not intended for everyone. For one, they only target **ArchLinux** with a profile fix just for **KDE Plasma**, for two, they heavily rely on your knowledge in using the **ArchInstall** script provided by **ArchLinux**.

So if you prefer the GUI route then, by all means use a distro that provides it. There is no harm in doing that. It's all about choice. I will never force you to use my tools, or say that they are *The only way* to install Arch. You are entitled to your own preferences. Who am I to judge you for your choices ?

If you are as much of a *Linux G33k* as I am, then those tools were created with you in mind.

Have fun & let me know how it goes.
