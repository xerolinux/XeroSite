### Description

With **XeroLinux** no longer being a Distro, but a collection of _Projects/Scripts_, created with a simple goal in mind, making [**ArchLinux**](https://archlinux.org) more approachable, easier to install and configure. That's if you choose to use it, or even give it a try.

Don't forget to [follow me](https://fosstodon.org/@XeroLinux) on Fosstodon.

### Point of this site

Our job from now on, on this site, is, to bring you the most useful **FOSS** tools and guides alongside our various projects as we work on them. It's your one-stop shop for those kinds of posts.

As mentioned on a dedicated post, we will not be posting any news, Distro reviews and Vs. articles to avoid any drama, and because news tend to get old real fast. Also we try to avoid opinionated posts as much as we can.

I have so many great ideas in the pipeline, it's crazy !

Enjoy your stay here.

Cheers y'all ðŸ˜€
