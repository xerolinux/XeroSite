### Intro

So, I was thinking, why be the only one submitting content for the site ? This site is now a place to post **Linux** news, guides, and tools among other stuff. It's all for sharing our love for **FOSS**.

### How to create content

In case you feel like doing a write up that you think would be useful to others, you can do that, and guess what, it's super easy... It's just a single *markdown* file called `index.md` which contains the text and an image called `featured.png` inside a folder named `post-title`. That's it ! Once that's done you zip them n send my way when I will go through it clean it up n publish...

Don't forget to update the date of the post in `date:`, also give it a short descriptive `title:` with a good `description`. Finally use the right `tags:` as shown in the screenshot. If in doubt click this  to check >> [**Template**](https://github.com/xerolinux/XeroHub/tree/main/content/posts/spotube-for-spotify)

With that out of the way, for more information about the various supported **Shortcodes** you can use, you can find them here >> [**BlowFish Shortcodes**](https://blowfish.page/docs/shortcodes/).

Thanks again & Cheers :heart:
