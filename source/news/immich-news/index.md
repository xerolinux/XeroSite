I know I previously said no news on this site as they get old. But I thought this one requires your attention, so there you go. It's not news as much as it is an awareness post, letting you know more about what's going on in **Immich** land.

### What's Immich ?

**Immich**, is an open-source self-hosted photo and video backup solution, it has captured many users’ hearts worldwide and recently celebrated a remarkable achievement: reaching `40,000 stars` on GitHub. For reference, in April 2022, the number was just 1,000.

### controversial Feature

In a previous update, version 1.109, **Immich**, has unveiled a new initiative to enhance support for its development and upkeep. Here's a breakdown of the changes.

It introduced two types of licenses with this update:

- A Server License and the Individual License. Priced at $99.99, is suitable for extensive setups as it covers all users on a single server.
- An Individual License, costing $24.99, offers more flexibility by allowing users to apply it to any server of their choice.

Some of you out there might see this and decide to run for the hills. Please don't, and continue reading otherwise you will end up judging it too harshly.

### Licensing Explained

Introducing these licenses comes on the heels of the Immich team’s new full-time commitment to the project, thanks to their exciting partnership with **FUTO**.

Now, let's clear up a big question! **Immich** is still as **free** and **open-source** as it’s always been. These licenses are just a way to support the project, and skipping them won't block any features or functionalities.

So as you can see the product is not as bad as you think. It's an opt-in feature, not an opt out one. So please don't be too negative on the devs.

Responding to community feedback, they’ve revamped how you can purchase Immich. They also playfully named these updates *“The-Words-Which-Must-Not-Be-Named.”* The goal? To make buying options and licensing clearer and more user-friendly.

For instance, a shiny new “Buy” button will appear once your account hits the 14-day mark. And don't worry, they included options to hide this button temporarily or forever, because who doesn’t love a good disappearing act?

### More New Features

But wait, there’s more! Immich 1.110 isn't just about the new licensing options. It also packs some nifty technical upgrades. Ever had trouble with thumbnails for **iOS18 HEIC** files or **motion photos** on your Pixel 6, 7, or 8? Problem solved!

And to make things even easier, we’ve rolled out the *“My Immich”* URL forwarder. This handy tool saves your instance URL on your first visit and makes navigating your server-specific settings a breeze. It’s like having a personal assistant for your photo and video backups, minus the coffee runs.

- **Map Tiles**

Say goodbye to third-party providers! Immich now proudly hosts its very own [**Map Tiles**](https://tiles.immich.cloud). This change brings a performance boost and less reliance on external services, making your map navigation faster and smoother, whether you're in light or dark mode.

- **Supporter Recognition**

To show some love to our financial backers, Immich has rolled out a product key-claiming mechanism on a dedicated website. Plus, you can now sport a shiny new supporter badge on your profile. Not a fan of badges? You can hide it if you prefer a more low-key look.

- **Enhanced Security with TLS Client Certificates**

In Immich 1.110, security gets a boost! You can now add custom TLS certificates to the mobile app, perfect for those with specific network configurations. It’s like putting your app in a high-tech security bubble.

- **Machine Learning and More**

This update isn’t just about looks and security. We’ve ramped up our machine learning game, especially with ARM-NN and OpenVINO support. This means better compatibility and faster performance across a variety of hardware. It’s like giving your devices a brain upgrade!

### Wrapping up

There you have it folks. We shouldn't judge a book by its cover as the saying goes. In this case we shouldn't hate on a project as big as Immich when they clearly show that they care about the **FOSS** community listening to us. I hope you have enjoyed this post. As usual find a link to their git below.
