### This one such a time saver..

**Converseen** can do batch image conversion, apply similar alteration like rotation, resize, remove image metadata, let you ignore specific files if you import a collection. Save the output in many different formats (with specific saving parameters like jpg quality, replace transparent background with specific color). The only thing It misses, in my opinion (imo) to make it GOAT is the ability to add/apply imported watermarks/copyright footnotes. A feature that can help visual artist to prepare their images galleries for publication.

Nonetheless it is already awesome because it helps convert files from annoying formats like .webp, switch .bmp into .png. in one click once the parameter are set.

### Demo

There is a quick demo I found in french but if there is request for it I can post one in English later. I personally use this on the daily especially for posting on sites and whatnot.

### Installing it

There are multiple ways to get it, be it from **Arch** repos or **Flathub**. I will be showing both methods, up to you to choose which you prefer...

- Arch Repos :
```Bash
sudo pacman -S converseen
```

- Flathub (Flatpak)
```Bash
flatpak install net.fasterland.converseen
```
