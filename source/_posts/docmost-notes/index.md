### Quick Installation Guide: Summon Docmost in a Jiffy

Ready to summon Docmost into your digital realm? Follow these steps for a quick and easy installation:

**Prerequisites :**

Before you begin, make sure you have Docker installed on your server. See the [**official Docker installation guide**](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) based on your OS.

- **Setup the Docker compose file**

Create a new directory for Docmost and download the Docker compose file with commands below:

```Bash
mkdir docmost
cd docmost
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docmost/docmost/main/docker-compose.yml
```

Next, open the docker-compose.yml file. On Linux, you can use vim:

```Bash
vi docker-compose.yml
```

The downloaded `docker-compose.yml` file should contain the template below with default environment variables.

- **Replace the default configs :**

You are to replace the default environment variables in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

The `APP_URL` should be replaced with your chosen domain. E.g. `https://example.com` or `https://docmost.example.com`.

The `APP_SECRET` value must be replaced with a long random secret key. You can generate the secret with `openssl rand -hex 32`. If you leave the default value, the app will fail to start.

Replace `STRONG_DB_PASSWORD` in the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` environment variable with a secure password.

Update the `DATABASE_URL` default `STRONG_DB_PASSWORD` value with your chosen Postgres password.

To configure Emails or File storage driver, see the [**Configuration**](https://docmost.com/docs/self-hosting/configuration) doc. The default File storage driver is `local storage`. You don't have to do anything unless you wish to use S3 storage.

- **Start the Services :**

Make sure you are inside the docmost directory which contains the `docker-compose.yml` file.

To start the services, run:

```Bash
docker compose up -d
```

Once the services are up and running, verify the installation by opening your web browser and navigating to: `http://localhost:3000` or the domain that points to your server.

If all is set, you should see the Docmost setup page which will enable you set up your workspace and account.

After a successful setup, you will become the workspace owner. You can then invite other users to join your workspace. Congratulations ðŸŽ‰.
