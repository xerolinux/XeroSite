### What is it?

Scrcpy is free, open-source **Android screen-mirroring** application that lets you use your Android with Scrcpy for Windows, macOS, or even Linux. But it's not the only one. Many software and applications let you control your phone or view your phone's content on other devices. However, every tool has its own flaws and shortcomings.

There is no need to root your devices since it's an open-source application. Whether you want to run Scrcpy on multiple devices, use applications on your phone, or even share files across two phones, Scrcpy is a perfect solution.

üìÇ Copy files to your mobile with drag & drop<br>
‚å®Ô∏è Control playback using your keyboard or even play games<br>

üì∑ Mirroring as a WebCam only on Linux

### How Does Scrcpy Work?

It's a question of many.

How does **Scrcpy** work, or how to use Scrcpy on Android?

It's important to understand the working of the software. When you connect devices via Scrcpy, it will execute a server on the connected devices. As a result, the client and server will communicate over a specific protocol to run the video on the connected device screen. The client(your computer/laptop) instantly decodes the video frames and shows them as your Android's HD mirror. Whether you're using Android with a mouse or keyboard, the client and server communicate to give you an uninterrupted session.

### Bonus : GUI Version of SCRCPY

If you prefer a GUI based version of SCRCPY, there is one. However it's not as maintained as the official version. It uses `QT` so it works best on those types of DEs, like **KDE Plasma**, **LXQT** and so on. To install it from the AUR

```Bash
paru -S qtscrcpy
```
