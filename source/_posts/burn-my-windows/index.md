**The key points are:**

### Install it on Plasma

There are multiple ways to install this extension. One of them being from the [**KDE Store**](https://www.pling.com/find?search=burn-my-windows) on many distros running **KDE Plasma** or the **A.U.R** on **ArchLinux**. Here I will be showing you the latter.

```Bash
paru -S kwin-effects-burn-my-windows

### Closing words

I understand some of you might be thinking, "Why add more features to an already feature-rich desktop environment?" My response is simple: no one is forcing you to. I'm sharing this because **Plasma** is incredibly customizable, so why not enhance it with some cool effects? I personally enjoy them and find them quite neat. If you don't, feel free to skip them. It's as simple as that. I'm not trying to be harshâ€”just acknowledging that many of us tend to have very strong opinions when it comes to such things.

It's that simple!!
