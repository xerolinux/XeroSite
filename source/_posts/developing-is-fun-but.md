### Am I a Developer ?

Lol, yeah I know, it's a question I do get a lot. But in my humble opinion, no I am not, far from it, I am just a guy who at most messes with code, specifically **Bash**, I take what I understand, put it together in a way that makes sense, to me at least, and hope it works. That's all I do.

And if it does work, I am happy and share result with the **FOSS** community.

### It's fun until...

Doing this is super fun and fulfilling. That's until I hit a brick wall, and stop getting any new fresh ideas, or when I find no solution to what I am trying to accomplish. Yes it's super frustrating.

Now, I know I can reach out to the **FOSS** community for help, only, not all of it is sunshine n roses. I do try, but I mostly get more frustrated with the difference of opinion out there. No matter how much I try to satisfy some requests, I can't do it for everyone.

Sometimes, I do meet some of the elitists out there, who think their opinion is the only one that matters. I alway make the mistake of replying to them, when it's better I ignore them. Yes those types of people exist everywhere, not only in **FOSS**. But alas that's where feel it the most. Especially when we try to monetize our work. But I already discussed that in another post.

Nevertheless, once a project is complete, the feeling of accomplishment is so rewarding lol.

### Sharing is caring

This the part where I say, please do not keep your work to yourself. Please share with the community, who knows maybe you will get someone who will help take your project to another level.

I used to keep stuff to myself, that's until I began sharing, that's when everything took off and I was able to help others. If it's not a project, maybe the knowledge you have gained, share it by helping others when and where you can.

"Sharing is caring" as the saying goes. Anyway I hope this quick post was a good read. Enjoy ;)
