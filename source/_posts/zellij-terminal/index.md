### What is Zellij?

Another day another Terminal utility. **Zellij** is a terminal workspace. It has the base functionality of a terminal multiplexer (similar to `tmux` or `screen`) but includes many built-in features that would allow users to extend it and create their own personalized environment. Visit [**Official Site**](https://zellij.dev) for more. Or watch video below.

### How to get it?

There are 2 ways to get it, either via your Arch package manager or a CURL command. However the devs recommend the latter. I will post both below.

![Zellij](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zellij-org/zellij/main/assets/demo.gif)

**- Arch's Pacman**
```Bash
sudo pacman -S --noconfirm zellij
```

**- Recommended CURL command**
```Bash
bash <(curl -L zellij.dev/launch)
```

However you choose to get it is up to you. Anyway here's a link to their **Github** page below.
