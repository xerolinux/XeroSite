### What is OBS Studio?

**OBS Studio** is a free and open-source, cross-platform screencasting and streaming app. It is available for Windows, macOS, Linux distributions, and BSD. The OBS Project raises funds on Open Collective and Patreon.

### Info

We ship the "Official" Flatpak version of OBS-Studio via our toolkit. The best part of it is, we don't just ship the main package alone, we have included some extra plugins too.. Specifically made for the flatpak version.
