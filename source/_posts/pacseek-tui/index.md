### Intro

I just found a neat little tool called "**Pacseek**" which is a terminal user interface for searching and installing **Arch** Linux packages...

### What is it?

Pacseek is terminal user interface, written in **Rust** which allows you to browse and search through the **Arch Linux** package databases as well as the **Arch User Repository**.

### How to get it ?

There are multiple ways to get it, but for sake of completeness, we will get it from the AUR. To install it from there, just use the following command:

```Bash
paru/yay -S pacseek-bin
```

### Closing words

I use this on a daily. It's highly recommended for the *G33ks* out there who love the terminal like I do. If you prefer **GUIs** then this is not for you, instead use something you prefer. Anyway below is a link to project **Github**
