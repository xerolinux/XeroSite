### What is it?

**Ferdium** is a desktop app that helps you organize how you use your favourite apps by combining them into one application. It is based on Franz - a software already used by thousands of people - with the difference that Ferdium gives you many additional features and doesn't restrict its usage!

Furthermore, Ferdium is compatible with your existing Franz and Ferdi account, so you can continue right where you left off. Find out more about Ferdium and its features on ferdium.org.

### Demo

There is a quick demo I found. I personally use this on the daily especially for saving on monitor space. I know we can use workspaces, only I hate that. Call me weird I do not mind it one bit.

### Installing it

There are multiple ways to get it, be it from **AUR** or **Flathub**. I will be showing both methods, up to you to choose which you prefer...

- AUR package :
```Bash
paru/yay -S ferdium-bin
```

- Flathub (Flatpak)
```Bash
flatpak install -y flathub org.ferdium.Ferdium
```

Have fun :heart:
