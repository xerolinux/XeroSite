### What is it?

Our good friend from [**ML4W**](https://gitlab.com/stephan-raabe) just posted a video showing us how to have both **Plasma 6** and **Hyprland** side-by-side with his awesome dotfiles.. Check it out below with links to his repositories...

### Where to get it ?

Project is hosted over on **Gitlab**. View card below. But please all I ask is for you not to report any issues to me as I do not use nor will I ever use **Hyprland**. Please do so directly to author, by opening issues. Keep in mind that you will need an account for that.
