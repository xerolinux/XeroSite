### Intro

I just ran across a video by **@MattTLC** from [TheLinuxCast](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheLinuxCast/videos) about a neat fully-featured Terminal Emulator called [Tabby](https://tabby.sh). I kinda like it, and I will be adding it to our package manager as an option. Maybe you like it too and want to give it a go. Saving you the hassle of building it from the AUR..

## Grab it Now

You can install the binary from the AUR. Keep in mind that it's the binary itâ€™s the binary (bin) version, not built from source. Saves time and errors. So use below command to install.

```Bash
paru -S tabby-bin
```

This thing has so many neat features that make life so much easier, just keep in mind that I, myself don't use it, as a result I can't help with it. To know more use the documentation found on the Project's **Github**.

Note :

> This terminal Emulator, as awesome as it can be for some, is more resource hungry. So unless you are willing to put up with this for the convenience it provides, I recommend not using it on a low end system, it just might be too much of a lag fest there..

Yet another tool to add to the arsenal...
