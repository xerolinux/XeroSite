I recommend you read it if you are new and want to understand the world you will be diving into.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-linux\">What is Linux ?<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#what-is-linux\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>Since not everyone's super familiar with Linux, here's a quick crash course.</p>\n<p>Linux is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_kernel#:~:text=A%20monolithic%20kernel%20is%20an,virtual%20interface%20over%20computer%20hardware.\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Monolithic Kernel</strong></a>, so all the drivers and whatnot are compiled into the binary. The <a href=\"https://www.fsf.org/about/what-is-free-software\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Nonfree software</strong></a> is usually put in the actual source repo as binary blobs, or in the case of <strong>nVidia</strong> drivers, built using a system called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Kernel_Module_Support\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>DKMS</strong></a> and compiled into the kernel binary. Once the computer boots up, an init process is started (the default is <code>/sbin/init</code>, usually a symlink to your init system), which is <code>PID 1</code>. This is when userspace is initialized. Due to security concerns and whatnot, you are restricted from having too much fun in userspace, so you need to ask the kernel to read files and allocate memory for you using syscalls. Anyways, init starts all the userspace stuff (it itself is run in userspace) and this keeps the system secure. Since Linux is monolithic, you can't just throw a malicious library into kernel space at runtime somehow, you have to compile it in. Anyways, Linux is a lot like Unix, with one notable difference being that Linux Is Not UniX. This means it uses the typical Unixy way of doing things like restricting access based on users and groups, being <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>POSIX</strong></a> compliant, and not really caring about file extensions.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <img width=\"600\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Mu7NHx9.png\" alt=\"logo\">\n</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"distros-pkg-managers\">Distros &amp; PKG Managers<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#distros-pkg-managers\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>On <a href=\"https://www.debian.org\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Debian</strong></a>, you install packages with <code>apt</code>. If you can't remember the package name you want, you can use apt to search for it, or use synaptic as a <em>GUI</em> frontend. If your desktop environment comes with one, you can use theirs, as that one should be easier to use, while still providing the exact same functionality. You don't install programs by downloading them from the internet. If you have any questions, the <a href=\"https://wiki.debian.org/DontBreakDebian\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Debian Wiki</strong></a> is pretty mid, but the <a href=\"https://wiki.archlinux.org\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Arch Wiki</strong></a> is amazing.</p>\n<p>Since <a href=\"https://archlinux.org\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Arch Linux</strong></a> is intended to be the most generic <em>Linux distro</em> ever, stuff written for <strong>Arch</strong> should also help with <strong>Debian</strong>, as long as the Arch package didn't get a bunch of major updates in the interim. There are also other ways of installing stuff, like <strong>Flatpak</strong> (sandboxed apps that \"just work\" on every distribution), and <strong>Snap</strong> (Ubuntu's sandboxed apps that they claim work on every distribution but have always been kind of sketchy). There are also <strong>AppImages</strong> which are basically like <code>.exe's</code> on <strong>Windows</strong>, but they're kind of a hassle to use compared to the others because you have to add executable permission to them, and then manually double click them. Plus they won't have a desktop entry.</p>\n<h3 id=\"filesystem-updates\">Filesystem &amp; Updates<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#filesystem-updates\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>If you are connecting the system to the internet, you should update at least once a week, so you don't get your entire network hacked through a known vulnerability. If you aren't connecting it to the internet, you can choose whether to update or not --it might fix a bug.</p>\n<p>As for the filesystem, <code>/etc</code> is where your Editable Text Configurations go. <code>/usr</code> is where program files go. <code>/usr/local</code> is where program files go for programs you manually installed. <code>/home</code> is where your stuff goes. <code>/dev</code> is for devices. there is no <strong>C</strong> drive or <strong>D</strong> drive, you have to mount the external drive to the place you choose, for example, <code>/mnt</code>. A <em>GUI</em> file manager mounts flash drives somewhere in <code>/run</code> usually, because it's temporary. <code>/opt</code> is where random stuff goes, and <code>/var</code> is for variable storage like system logs. <code>/tmp</code> is self-explanatory. <code>/dev/null</code> is a bottomless pit, and <code>/dev/urandom</code> is a quick and easy IO-based random number generator. In <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>UNIX</strong></a>, everything is a file. This means you can see process details by reading the files in <code>/proc</code>, see system settings or driver configs in /sys, or see your bootloader in <code>/boot</code></p>\n<h3 id=\"wrapping-it-all-up\">Wrapping it all up<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#wrapping-it-all-up\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>This here was a quick run-through explaining what <strong>GNU/Linux</strong> is written as mentioned earlier by a good friend. I did not post it on main site simply because I feel it's not as complete as I would like it to be.</p>\n<p>So please do not take it a complete walk-through, We did not even go through the various <em>Desktop Environments</em> or even <em>Window Managers</em> that exist today, way too many to list.

This is where I will be posting my thoughts, feelings and some documentation for myself so I do not have to keep looking for them. Keep in mind that all the opinions, thoughts and feelings are my own. Also any documentation found here will be mostly modified to work for me. If I find something useful I will share it on the <a href=\"https://xerolinux.xyz\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>XeroLinux</strong></a> main site.</p>\n<p>I have always been captivated by the limitless potential of Linux, especially when it comes to mastering Arch Linux with its rich, customizable environment. From the very first moment of installing Arch and navigating the bare essentials, the thrill of uncovering the vast ecosystem of Linux has only intensified. It's a world where every command, every configuration file, and every script opens a new door to possibilities, and the joy of understanding how things work under the hood is unparalleled. This passion extends beyond just my personal journey; it's about fostering a community of like-minded individuals who are just as enthusiastic about diving into the depths of Linux. There's something incredibly fulfilling in sharing that \"Aha!\" moment with someone else, whether it's explaining the finer points of Bash scripting, demystifying a complex package manager, or finding the most efficient way to automate a tedious task. Every encounter with another learner is an opportunity to grow together, and I cherish these exchanges as a way to contribute to the broader Linux community.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <img width=\"600\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZAvPAkx.png\" alt=\"logo\">\n</p>\n\n<p>Documenting my learning journey has become an essential part of this experience. The importance of writing down processes, solutions, and insights cannot be overstated. It's not just a tool for personal growth; it's a powerful way to make life less stressful. There\u2019s a kind of magic in creating a reference that captures every little detail, every lesson learned, and every problem solved. Instead of wracking my brain trying to recall a solution from memory or scouring forums and wikis repeatedly for the same answers, I believe that a well-documented note can save time, reduce frustration, and make troubleshooting a far less daunting task. It becomes a reliable companion, ready to guide me whenever a familiar issue arises or a new challenge demands attention.</p>\n<p>I will be sharing some posts from here on my <a href=\"https://fosstodon.org/@XeroLinux\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Fosstodon</strong></a>, so if you follow me there, you will see them. If not than what are you waiting for ? <strong>DO IT</strong> lol.

Your support and feedback are always appreciated. Now, let\u2019s dive in.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><img alt=\"type:video\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BpmAFwZy0Gg\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"my-frustration\">My Frustration<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#my-frustration\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>Recently, I\u2019ve been investing a lot of time and effort into my projects and contributing to <strong>FOSS</strong> (Free and Open Source Software) wherever possible. While I find this work rewarding, it\u2019s also been increasingly frustrating. Why? Let me explain.</p>\n<p>I spend countless hours working behind the scenes to make everyone\u2019s life easier. While there are a few of you who go above and beyond to support my work, and I am incredibly grateful for that, it\u2019s disheartening to see so little engagement overall. Feedback is crucial for improvement, and without issue reports or suggestions, it's challenging to know if I\u2019m making a real impact.</p>\n<h3 id=\"seeking-purpose\">Seeking Purpose<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#seeking-purpose\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>Initially, I embarked on this journey for fun and to learn new things. However, lately, I\u2019ve been questioning the purpose behind my efforts. It feels like I\u2019m stuck in a cycle of constant work with little to show for it. This isn\u2019t about blaming anyone; it\u2019s about seeking the motivation to keep going.</p>\n<h3 id=\"monetization-attempts\">Monetization Attempts<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#monetization-attempts\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>As my financial situation became more strained, I reluctantly turned to monetization. Many advised me to turn my passion into a viable source of income. So, I tried implementing a \"pay what you can\" model, hoping it would help sustain my work. However, this didn\u2019t go as planned.</p>\n<p>The <strong>FOSS</strong> community, known for its spirit of freedom, often struggles with the concept of financial support for free software. It\u2019s a complex issue, and while some have been supportive, overall, the response hasn\u2019t been enough to make a significant difference.</p>\n<h3 id=\"health-concerns\">Health Concerns<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#health-concerns\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>On top of these challenges, I have been dealing with significant health issues. Most notably, I have severe dental problems that require a full set of dentures. This isn\u2019t cheap, and without stable income, it\u2019s been impossible to address. These health issues have affected my confidence and my ability to engage publicly, adding another layer of difficulty to my situation. Health must come before everything else, including fun and passion projects.</p>\n<h3 id=\"mental-health-struggles\">Mental Health Struggles<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#mental-health-struggles\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>The stress from these financial and health challenges has also taken a toll on my mental health. I've been experiencing frequent anxiety and panic attacks, and the constant pressure has led to a deep sense of depression. The overwhelming silence and lack of engagement have exacerbated these feelings, making it even harder to stay motivated and productive.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-way-forward\">The Way Forward<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#the-way-forward\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>Given these circumstances, I\u2019m focusing more on forums and this blog. Writing provides a creative outlet that isn\u2019t constrained by algorithms or view counts. I\u2019ll continue to work on my current projects, primarily for my own needs, but I might keep some future creations private until I can find a sustainable way to share them.</p>\n<p>My main priority now is finding a stable job that can support my financial needs. If and when I achieve that stability, I plan to return to my passion projects with renewed energy and many new ideas.</p>\n<h3 id=\"closing-thoughts\">Closing Thoughts<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#closing-thoughts\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to those of you who continue to support my work.

It all started back in 2020, when I fell in love with <a href=\"https://kde.org\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>KDE Plasma</strong></a> while using the now infamous [<strong>Manjaro</strong>]{:target=\"_blank\"} Distrobution. Yes, this is when I got hooked to <strong>Linux</strong>. Now don't get me wrong, I have since tried many DEs and WMs. But alas only <strong>KDE Plasma</strong> answered my needs.</p>\n<p>Since then I started getting the urge to build my own <em>Distro</em> my way. With everything I wanted out the box. At first it was hard, real hard. I couldn't find an easy way to do it. That's until I stumbled upon a project we all know and love called <a href=\"https://arcolinux.info\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>ArcoLinux</strong></a>. Yep, they are all about learning and becoming self-reliant. Especially that it was based on my favorite builder Distro <a href=\"https://archlinux.org\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>ArchLinux</strong></a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fundraising\">Fundraising<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#fundraising\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>Now we get to the meat and potatoes of this post, why ask for money when it's <strong>FOSS</strong> ? Well in case you did not know, the <em>Free</em> in <em>Free Open Source</em> does <strong>NOT</strong> mean free of charcge, instead it means Freedom to fork and do with what you want. So us Developers have all the right in the word to charge for our time. Read that again, charge for our <strong>TIME</strong>.</p>\n<p>Many of us are just contributers, contributing much of our free time, constantly giving without asking for anything in return. Which means no R.O.I (return on time invested). Some, not many, with a <em>real</em> job can do that for a long time, with the rest of us without one, or having difficulties IRL, use the knowledge and creations as a sole means of survival. Especially as a single individual.</p>\n<p>Now, I do agree with you when you say, we shouldn't force you to pay. That's why we use the <em>Fundraising</em> or <em>Donation</em> methods. While we do not force you, it would be great if you did. Would help both of us. You get a useful product while we are able to survive to give you more. A Win-Win scenario. So if you feel like helping me out financially, you can do so via the <strong>Donate</strong> button in the menu up top or on the side if you are on mobile, or via button below. Thanks ;)</p>\n<h3 id=\"hate-in-foss\">Hate in FOSS<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#hate-in-foss\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>Now let's address the <em>other</em> elephant in the room, the hate in the <strong>FOSS</strong> community. I see a lot of Devs out there, including myself receiving hate, for that reason. Simply because of the misinterpretation of the word <em>Free</em> in <em>Free Open Source</em>. That should stop. We need a more collaborative community. There are tons of friendly ones out there, but equally there are plenty who build projects for the sake of showing off how much they <em>despise</em> others, the ones we call <em>Protest Distros</em>. Now am not going to name any names here, but the longer this goes on, the slower <strong>Linux</strong> will grow.</p>\n<p>So if you love <strong>Linux</strong> as much as you say you do, please help your favorite projects grow in any way shape or form, either <em>Donating</em> for financial support if you can and are not a developer, or by simply <em>Reporting Issues</em> upstream helping them get better. Complaining for the sake of it, or hating will go nowhere.</p>\n<p>Anyways, thanks for reading this.

I\u2019m not looking to build a whole new rig, but I definitely need to swap out a few key parts like the <strong>CPU</strong> and <strong>GPU</strong>. With the <strong>XeroLinux</strong> Distro not coming back anytime soon, it\u2019s crucial to put funds towards these upgrades where they truly matter.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <img width=\"600\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/sy5D8T0.png\" alt=\"logo\">\n</p>\n\n<p>As you can see from image above, the <strong>GTX 1080</strong> (my current GPU) will be soon dropped from upcoming Open Module Drivers.. So I will be stuck with what it currently supports no future for me. As <em>nVidia</em> just announced it's going full Open-Source.

For the CPU, I\u2019m considering an upgrade to either the <a href=\"https://www.lebanonstores.com/shop-1/amd-ryzen-7-5800x3d-socket-am4\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Ryzen 7 5800X3D</strong></a> valued at $330 or the <a href=\"https://global.microless.com/product/amd-ryzen-9-5950x-16-core-3-4-ghz-socket-am4-105w-desktop-processor-100-100000059wof/\"><strong>Ryzen 9 5950X</strong></a> valued at $452.

I\u2019m still undecided between sticking with <strong>nVidia</strong> or switching to <strong>AMD</strong>. I am currently torn between the two. Now, I know most of you would recommend <strong>AMD</strong> because it\u2019s hassle-free on <strong>Linux</strong>\u2014and you\u2019d be right. But as a content creator who relies on <a href=\"https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Cuda</strong></a> and <strong>nVidia</strong>'s <a href=\"https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/guides/broadcasting-guide/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>nVenc Encoder</strong></a>, I\u2019m leaning towards sticking with nVidia.</p>\n<p>However, if I do decide to switch to Team Red, I\u2019d go for the <a href=\"https://www.lebanonstores.com/shop-1/amd-radeon-rx-6950xt-16gb\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>RX 6950XT</strong></a> currently valued at $400 here. Otherwise, if I stay with Team-Green, it\u2019s going to be the <a href=\"https://www.lebanonstores.com/shop-1/rtx-3090-msi-suprim-x-24gb\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>RTX 3090</strong></a> valued at $595.</p>\n<h4 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#conclusion\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h4>\n<p>Upgrading the <strong>GPU</strong> is my top priority right now, as it will make the most significant impact. My current <strong>GTX 1080</strong> is nearing its end-of-life, and I can manage with my <strong>Ryzen 5 3600X</strong> for a bit longer. So, if you can help me raise enough funds to upgrade the <strong>GPU</strong> and stay ahead in the <strong>Linux</strong> world, I\u2019d be incredibly grateful. If we can raise enough for both upgrades, it would be a huge boost to my setup and productivity.</p>\n<p>Every little bit helps, and if each of you who appreciates my work chips in just a few bucks, we\u2019ll reach the goal in no time.

This post doesn't belong on the main site but here, where I can speak candidly about how things have been and how we, as so-called Linux users, often behave. I'm as guilty as anyone else, so let's sit back, relax, grab a cup of coffee or a bottle of beer, and read on.</p>\n<h3 id=\"content-creators\">Content Creators<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#content-creators\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>Before diving in, I want to clarify that I am not a content creator. I've tried many times and failed miserably, so I don't include myself in this group for now. However, I need to address the challenges they face.</p>\n<p>YouTube content creators (CCs) do a thankless job. It's incredibly hard work, requiring meticulous planning, high-quality equipment, and, above all, an enormous amount of patience. Unfortunately, the comment sections are often filled with toxic trash talk, which can be demoralizing. Reading these negative comments can lead to feelings of depression and inadequacy, making creators feel they are not meeting viewer expectations. This is far from the truth. The reality is that satisfying everyone is impossible.</p>\n<p>Content creators invest significant time, money, and energy into producing videos that inform, entertain, and educate. Their efforts are crucial for enhancing our understanding and enjoyment of various topics. Even writers like myself sometimes rely on their videos to illustrate points or tools we discuss in our posts. Blog posts and YouTube videos complement each other, making our content more engaging and informative.</p>\n<h3 id=\"writers-blog-posters\">Writers / Blog Posters<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#writers-blog-posters\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>This is where I include myself. We do our best to bring you high-quality content. We strive to be as unbiased as possible, but mistakes happen. We are human and sometimes say the wrong things out of frustration, but that's no excuse.</p>\n<p>One common mistake we make is not doing enough research before posting. This can lead to a lack of primary sources to back up our claims, which makes our posts less trustworthy. Recently, it was brought to my attention that I was guilty of this. Instead of pushing away constructive criticism, I embraced it and made sure to do better. Thanks to a user on Discord, I\u2019ve learned to improve, and I thank them for that.</p>\n<h3 id=\"appreciating-content-creators-and-writers\">Appreciating Content Creators and Writers<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#appreciating-content-creators-and-writers\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>We often overlook the effort and dedication that content creators and writers put into their work. From brainstorming ideas to scripting, filming, editing, and publishing, every step requires significant effort and attention to detail. They often juggle these tasks alongside their personal and professional lives, making their commitment even more commendable.</p>\n<p>Both content creators and writers face the challenge of staying updated with the latest trends, technologies, and viewer preferences. This constant evolution demands flexibility and a willingness to learn and adapt. Despite these challenges, many persist, driven by their passion and dedication to their craft.</p>\n<p>As writers and bloggers, we pour our hearts into our work, aiming to provide valuable insights and information. We strive to deliver accurate and engaging content, but we are not infallible. Constructive feedback helps us grow and improve, enabling us to produce better content for our readers. It's essential to recognize that writing is an iterative process. Each piece we publish is a step towards improvement. Constructive criticism, when offered kindly and thoughtfully, is a valuable tool that helps us refine our skills and enhance the quality of our work.</p>\n<h3 id=\"fostering-a-positive-community\">Fostering a Positive Community<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#fostering-a-positive-community\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>The F.O.S.S.

Let's move away from harsh judgments and towards constructive dialogues that promote growth and understanding.</p>\n<p>When we encounter content we don't agree with, let's engage in respectful discussions. Share your perspectives, offer suggestions, and be open to different viewpoints. This approach enriches our community and helps content creators and writers deliver better content.</p>\n<p>Instead of judging writers and content creators harshly, provide constructive criticism and exchange ideas to help us improve and bring you more useful content. Many of us, myself included, have been guilty of negativity. This message serves as a reminder to be more supportive. Let's help each other grow in the F.O.S.S.

Yes it's super frustrating.</p>\n<p>Now, I know I can reach out to the <strong>FOSS</strong> community for help, only, not all of it is sunshine n roses. I do try, but I mostly get more frustrated with the difference of opinion out there. No matter how much I try to satisfy some requests, I can't do it for everyone.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, I do meet some of the elitists out there, who think their opinion is the only one that matters. I alway make the mistake of replying to them, when it's better I ignore them. Yes those types of people exist everywhere, not only in <strong>FOSS</strong>. But alas that's where we feel it the most. Especially when we try to monetize our work.

Yes a highly unlikly scenario I know. But the more I dug into the world of containerization the more intrigued I got. And that's when I discovered <strong>Docker</strong> containers, their countless uses. What blew me away mostly, is the fact that I can run cloud services like <a href=\"https://immich.app/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Immich</strong></a> for images and videos, which would allow me to sync my devices locally rather than with <a href=\"https://icloud.com\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Apple iCloud</strong></a> or <strong>Google</strong> making me the sole owner of my data. So freeing OMG !!! No longer bound by those shackles...</p>\n<p>With that, I the deeper I went through this bottomless rabbit hole, the more truly useful containers I found. The idea that I can do whatever I wanted without having to deal with any 3<sup>rd</sup> party conglomerates made me fall in love more and more as time went by...</p>\n<h3 id=\"my-setup-so-far\">My setup so far<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#my-setup-so-far\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>Yep, I know, you are eager to see what I have managed to pull off with everything I found.

Fitting name right ? I love its simplistic design, flexibility, and most of all what sold me on it is two-fold, the fact that everything is done via <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>YAML</strong></a> configurations files, and that the community behind it are so damn friendly ! Yep, there is no <em>dumb</em> question for them, they answer any and all to the best of their abilities.If you have any, feel free to join their <a href=\"https://discord.gg/k4ruYNrudu\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Discord Server</strong></a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>File Browser</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>As for the File Browser I use to share files between PCs, it's also has a <em>creative</em> name lol, just called <a href=\"https://filebrowser.org\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>FileBrowser</strong></a>, it serves one purpose, browsing files, with ability to upload &amp; download from/to any PC. That's it. It just works nothing else to say about that.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Search Engine (Xoogle)</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hehe, the only reason I called it <em>Xoogle</em> is coz it's Xero + Google, get it ? Anyway, this is using something called <a href=\"https://whoogle.io\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Whoogle</strong></a>, weird name I know, loogs damn ugly too. It's just a search engine that uses <strong>Google</strong> stripping it of all A.I crap and ads. Does its job I prefer it to any other coz I get the power of <strong>Google</strong> the way it was back in the day..</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Vaultwarden</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>That's a 3<sup>rd</sup>-party <a href=\"https://bitwarden.com\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Bitwarden</strong></a> server-as-a-container, endorsed by them so can be trusted called <a href=\"https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Vaultwarden</strong></a>. I use it coz I prefer to self-host private stuff like that. Where I have total control. I still keep a copy hosted by them. It's just in case they go under I am safe.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>ShareX</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This one is not for everyone. It uses <a href=\"https://zipline.diced.sh\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Zipline</strong></a>. It's a File upload server with a twist. I exposed mine to the web, using it to share files with friends. Use it if you need something like that.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>My Comics</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I am a big fan of comic books, especially the ones from my childhood. This container uses <a href=\"https://kavitareader.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Kavita</strong></a>. I love it simplicity. I am also proud to say that I currently sponsor their work coz devs are very friendly so is this tool. It works for my needs, I hope it does for you in case you choose to use it.

Have fun.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>FreshRSS</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>That too doesn't need an introduction, just that it's the feed agregator I chose to use. Called <a href=\"https://www.freshrss.org\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>FreshRSS</strong></a>. It's simple to use, looks good enough, and supports tons of plugins to extend it above and beyond.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Immich</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, this is one of the big ones, <a href=\"https://immich.app\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Immich</strong></a> is an amazing image cloud like service. Allowing you to move away from <strong>Apple</strong> and <strong>Google</strong>. I love that as I said at the beginning of this long post.

What I first started it, I thought so many people making tons of money, why shouldn't I ? Well, it took me so long to get monetization abilites, and when I did I was like, <strong>Nice!</strong>.</p>\n<p>But as time went by it became more and more difficult to come up with new ideas to keep it interesting. So I gave up for a while. Then, after 6 to 8 months I came back, rest is history.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-now-xero\">What now Xero ?<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#what-now-xero\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>Hehe, I do not know to be perfectly honest. Am not getting enough views, and my Live Streams are only getting 6 to 8 participants. Also the ideas, quality, and equipment not being available to continue. There's also the fact that there's no point of monetizing my content since <strong>YouTube</strong> and my Bank, the only one I can use are not talking to each other, without any way for me to fix that. All these issues piling up.</p>\n<p>So, in the next few days or weeks, I will be killing ads on all my videos, making your viewing experience a much better one with 0 ads to skip through.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whats-the-catch\">What's the Catch ?<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#whats-the-catch\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>This comes with a caveat, since I won't be making any money there, due to the mentioned issue, I will instead have not choice but to rely on the <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/XeroLinux\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>XeroLinux Ko-Fi</strong></a> fundraiser for the forseeable future.</p>\n<p>Why there ? Err, coz that's the only service that has no issues with my bank. Simple as that. I hope you understand my situation here. As I mentioned on a previous post, you are not obligated to <em>donate</em>, however would be highly appreciated if you do.</p>\n<h3 id=\"whats-the-plan-moving-foreward\">What's the plan moving foreward ?<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#whats-the-plan-moving-foreward\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>When it comes to plans for the channel from this point on, simple, I will be using it as a tool. What I mean by that is, I will be publishing videos only when I feel the situation needs it, for example if I feel a guide I want to put out cannot be done in writing. Or when I need to show off a tool/script am working on. You get the idea.</p>\n<p>As to what day videos will be published, I will do it on a <strong>Wednesday</strong> whenever there is one. Also, do not worry about monthly Live Streams, they are here to stay. And when I get the chance, maybe bring back the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeTlEEB2MZX6iUQWtkOCCcAm-edlLVCf4\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>XeroTalk</strong></a> seriles, where I sit down with various personalities in the <strong>Linux</strong> sphere and talk about various topics. Who knows.</p>\n<p>Bottom line is, my channel is nothing but a tool, not a way to monetize anymore. I hope I don't lose you as a subscriber because of this. However, it's fine if you feel the need to leave, no harm no foul.</p>\n<p>Anyways, thanks again for reading this.

Read on...</p>\n<h3 id=\"xerolinux-is-back-but-why\">XeroLinux is back, But why?<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#xerolinux-is-back-but-why\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>To explain why, let me set the stage. As you may already know, I\u2019m going through significant financial difficulties. Living in <strong>Lebanon</strong>, finding a job\u2014especially a remote one\u2014is extremely challenging, and the situation continues to worsen. I won\u2019t rehash the entire story here, but if you\u2019re not familiar, you can read more about it in this <a href=\"https://blog.techxero.com/index.php/2024/06/07/actively-looking-for-a-job/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>BlogPost</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>After giving it a lot of thought, I realized how much I truly enjoy Linux. With bills to pay and my distro\u2019s code still sitting on GitHub, it just makes sense. Many of you have been asking me to bring it back since I pulled the plug months ago, so why not use this opportunity to revive it\u2014and make it a way to sustain myself?</p>\n<p>Not to forget that I've been running it on my own this whole time, and maintaining the ISO was a blast. I've been itching to bring it back, especially since it was rapidly climbing the <strong>DistroWatch</strong> rankings as a popular distro. Seeing how much you all loved it made me feel guilty for taking something great away from you. Thanks for making it feel so special!</p>\n<p>That answers the why.</p>\n<h3 id=\"how-is-it-being-distributed\">How is it being distributed ?<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#how-is-it-being-distributed\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>I've decided to put the distro behind a donation wall. By supporting me financially, you'll gain access to the XeroLinux ISO\u2014a true Win-Win. Your support helps me keep going, and you get something valuable in return. For more details, check out the <a href=\"https://xerolinux.xyz/iso/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Release Post</strong></a></p>\n<p>Now I know that some of you will go, \"but it's FOSS, you shouldn't charge for it.\" to which I will say the same thing I have been for a long time, the <em>Free</em> in <em>Free Open Source</em> does <strong>NOT</strong> mean free of charge, just means <em>Freedom</em> to fork the <a href=\"https://github.com/XeroLinuxDev\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Source Code</strong></a> and do with it as you wish. I am just charging for my time.</p>\n<p>The distro will be continuously updated to ensure it works seamlessly and will stay alive as long as I have your support. If support ever dries up\u2026 well, let's not dwell on that. Let\u2019s focus on keeping it alive and thriving for a long and happy journey together!</p>\n<h3 id=\"is-it-any-special\">Is it any Special?<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#is-it-any-special\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>Common question I get. To be honest, there\u2019s no groundbreaking advantage\u2014it simply provides an easier way to install <strong>Arch</strong> with a polished <strong>KDE</strong> experience right out of the box, which many users seem to appreciate. I created it specifically for them, an alternative to my DIY install script, and as a way to offer support.</p>\n<p>Users are free to prefer any other Distro over mine. Am not and will never force it. Also I have never pretended that <strong>XeroLinux</strong> is better than any other distro. It's never been a competition. I would hate for people to think it was. I hope this clarifies things.</p>\n<h3 id=\"can-i-get-it-for-free\">Can I get it for free?<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#can-i-get-it-for-free\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>If you can\u2019t support me financially but still want <strong>XeroLinux</strong>, while the ISO isn't available for free right now, you can still achieve similar results with my <a href=\"https://github.com/xerolinux/xero-plasma\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>PlasmaInstall</strong></a> script, which will always be free of charge. It just requires a bit more elbow grease on your part\u2014that\u2019s all there is to it!</p>\n<h3 id=\"i-dont-like-arch\">I don't like Arch<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#i-dont-like-arch\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>In case you don't like <strong>Arch</strong> for whatever reason, but still want to support me, I have put up a <a href=\"https://shop.xerolinux.xyz\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Merch Store</strong></a> where you will be able to buy something you like. Not much there yet, will have many more items in the near future. It's just there as an alternative way for you to help out.</p>\n<h3 id=\"private-donations\">Private Donations<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#private-donations\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>Did you know I have a private fundraiser account? It\u2019s been around forever! If you'd like to support me directly with things like rent and general wellbeing, you can do so at <a href=\"https://fundrazr.com/xerolinux\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>FundRazr</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>Currently, all funds raised from the ISO are split into two categories: private and project. About 60% goes toward improving <strong>XeroLinux</strong>, covering costs like hosting, domains, and other essentials. The remaining 40% helps me with personal expenses like health, phone bills, etc., mainly because my other account hasn\u2019t been getting much support. Ideally, I\u2019d love to keep these funds separate, but ultimately, it\u2019s your choice.</p>\n<h3 id=\"wrapping-up\">Wrapping up<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#wrapping-up\" title=\"Permanent link\">&para;</a></h3>\n<p>That's it, now you know the why and the how. So let's keep the distro alive. Keep sharing it and the store with others. I try to be as honest and open about everything. I got nothing to hide.</p>\n<p>Thank you to each and everyone for the support.</p>", "image": "https://bytes.xerolinux.xyz/assets/images/social/projects/why-is-distro-back.png", "date_modified": "2024-09-04T22:23:03+03:00", "authors": [], "tags": ["ArchLinux", "Linux", "XeroLinux"]}]}
