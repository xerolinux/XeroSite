I've tried many times and failed miserably, so I don't include myself in this group for now. However, I need to address the challenges they face.</p> <p>YouTube content creators (CCs) do a thankless job. It's incredibly hard work, requiring meticulous planning, high-quality equipment, and, above all, an enormous amount of patience. Unfortunately, the comment sections are often filled with toxic trash talk, which can be demoralizing. Reading these negative comments can lead to feelings of depression and inadequacy, making creators feel they are not meeting viewer expectations. This is far from the truth. The reality is that satisfying everyone is impossible.</p> <p>Content creators invest significant time, money, and energy into producing videos that inform, entertain, and educate. Their efforts are crucial for enhancing our understanding and enjoyment of various topics.

So freeing OMG !!! No longer bound by those shackles...</p> <p>With that, I the deeper I went through this bottomless rabbit hole, the more truly useful containers I found.

Anyway, here's a screenshot, and below it I will link to the various containers I am using in case you find them useful.</p> <p> </p> <ul> <li>Homepage</li> </ul> <p>To start off, let me tell you what am using for the page you see in the image, it's simply called Homepage. Fitting name right ? I love its simplistic design, flexibility, and most of all what sold me on it is two-fold, the fact that everything is done via YAML configurations files, and that the community behind it are so damn friendly ! Yep, there is no dumb question for them, they answer any and all to the best of their abilities.If you have any, feel free to join their Discord Server.</p> <ul> <li>File Browser</li> </ul> <p>As for the File Browser I use to share files between PCs, it's also has a creative name lol, just called FileBrowser, it serves one purpose, browsing files, with ability to upload &amp; download from/to any PC. That's it. It just works nothing else to say about that.</p> <ul> <li>Search Engine (Xoogle)</li> </ul> <p>Hehe, the only reason I called it Xoogle is coz it's Xero + Google, get it ? Anyway, this is using something called Whoogle, weird name I know, loogs damn ugly too. It's just a search engine that uses Google stripping it of all A.I crap and ads. Does its job I prefer it to any other coz I get the power of Google the way it was back in the day..</p> <ul> <li>Vaultwarden</li> </ul> <p>That's a 3rd-party Bitwarden server-as-a-container, endorsed by them so can be trusted called Vaultwarden. I use it coz I prefer to self-host private stuff like that. Where I have total control. I still keep a copy hosted by them. It's just in case they go under I am safe.</p> <ul> <li>ShareX</li> </ul> <p>This one is not for everyone. It uses Zipline. It's a File upload server with a twist. I exposed mine to the web, using it to share files with friends. Use it if you need something like that.</p> <ul> <li>My Comics</li> </ul> <p>I am a big fan of comic books, especially the ones from my childhood. This container uses Kavita. I love it simplicity. I am also proud to say that I currently sponsor their work coz devs are very friendly so is this tool. It works for my needs, I hope it does for you in case you choose to use it. If you have any, feel free to join their Discord Server.</p> <ul> <li>Audiobookshelf</li> </ul> <p>I guess I do not need to explain that one. It's just a docker container for Audiobookshelf. In case you have some Audio books or podcasts. Have fun.</p> <ul> <li>FreshRSS</li> </ul> <p>That too doesn't need an introduction, just that it's the feed agregator I chose to use. Called FreshRSS. It's simple to use, looks good enough, and supports tons of plugins to extend it above and beyond.</p> <ul> <li>Immich</li> </ul> <p>Now, this is one of the big ones, Immich is an amazing image cloud like service. Allowing you to move away from Apple and Google. I love that as I said at the beginning of this long post. They even have companion apps for both Android and iOS which makes it even more amazing.

As you may already know, I\u2019m going through significant financial difficulties. Living in Lebanon, finding a job\u2014especially a remote one\u2014is extremely challenging, and the situation continues to worsen. I won\u2019t rehash the entire story here, but if you\u2019re not familiar, you can read more about it in this BlogPost.</p> <p>After giving it a lot of thought, I realized how much I truly enjoy Linux. With bills to pay and my distro\u2019s code still sitting on GitHub, it just makes sense. Many of you have been asking me to bring it back since I pulled the plug months ago, so why not use this opportunity to revive it\u2014and make it a way to sustain myself?</p> <p>Not to forget that I've been running it on my own this whole time, and maintaining the ISO was a blast. I've been itching to bring it back, especially since it was rapidly climbing the DistroWatch rankings as a popular distro. Seeing how much you all loved it made me feel guilty for taking something great away from you. Thanks for making it feel so special!</p> <p>That answers the why.</p>","tags":["Linux","XeroLinux","ArchLinux"]},{"location":"posts/why-is-distro-back/#how-is-it-being-distributed","title":"How is it being distributed ?","text":"<p>I've decided to put the distro behind a donation wall. By supporting me financially, you'll gain access to the XeroLinux ISO\u2014a true Win-Win. Your support helps me keep going, and you get something valuable in return. For more details, check out the Release Post</p> <p>Now I know that some of you will go, \"but it's FOSS, you shouldn't charge for it.\" to which I will say the same thing I have been for a long time, the Free in Free Open Source does NOT mean free of charge, just means Freedom to fork the Source Code and do with it as you wish. I am just charging for my time.</p> <p>The distro will be continuously updated to ensure it works seamlessly and will stay alive as long as I have your support. If support ever dries up\u2026 well, let's not dwell on that. Let\u2019s focus on keeping it alive and thriving for a long and happy journey together!</p>","tags":["Linux","XeroLinux","ArchLinux"]},{"location":"posts/why-is-distro-back/#is-it-any-special","title":"Is it any Special?","text":"<p>Common question I get. To be honest, there\u2019s no groundbreaking advantage\u2014it simply provides an easier way to install Arch with a polished KDE experience right out of the box, which many users seem to appreciate. I created it specifically for them, an alternative to my DIY install script, and as a way to offer support.</p> <p>Users are free to prefer any other Distro over mine. Am not and will never force it. Also I have never pretended that XeroLinux is better than any other distro. It's never been a competition. I would hate for people to think it was.

It\u2019s been around forever! If you'd like to support me directly with things like rent and general wellbeing, you can do so at FundRazr.</p> <p>Currently, all funds raised from the ISO are split into two categories: private and project. About 60% goes toward improving XeroLinux, covering costs like hosting, domains, and other essentials. The remaining 40% helps me with personal expenses like health, phone bills, etc., mainly because my other account hasn\u2019t been getting much support. Ideally, I\u2019d love to keep these funds separate, but ultimately, it\u2019s your choice.</p>","tags":["Linux","XeroLinux","ArchLinux"]},{"location":"posts/why-is-distro-back/#wrapping-up","title":"Wrapping up","text":"<p>That's it, now you know the why and the how.
