The Nonfree software is usually put in the actual source repo as binary blobs, or in the case of nVidia drivers, built using a system called DKMS and compiled into the kernel binary.</p> <p>Once the computer boots up, an init process is started (the default is <code>/sbin/init</code>, usually a symlink to your init system), which is <code>PID 1</code>. This is when userspace is initialized. Due to security concerns and whatnot, you are restricted from having too much fun in userspace, so you need to ask the kernel to read files and allocate memory for you using syscalls.</p> <p>Anyways, init starts all the userspace stuff (it itself is run in userspace) and this keeps the system secure. Since Linux is monolithic, you can't just throw a malicious library into kernel space at runtime somehow, you have to compile it in. Anyways, Linux is a lot like Unix, with one notable difference being that Linux Is Not UniX. This means it uses the typical Unixy way of doing things like restricting access based on users and groups, being POSIX compliant, and not really caring about file extensions.</p> <p> </p>","tags":["Linux","Kernel","Packages"]},{"location":"docs/linux-explained/#distros-pkg-managers","title":"Distros &amp; PKG Managers","text":"<p>On Debian, you install packages with <code>apt</code>.

He was not only a brilliant Linux enthusiast but also a vibrant soul who played a significant role in shaping the future of XeroLinux. His relentless pursuit of perfection and attention to detail, particularly when it came to consistency, pushed the project to heights it would never have reached without his insightful input.</p> <p> </p> <p>I will admit, there were times when I disagreed with his ideas, but his persistence, backed by reason and logic, often changed my mind. XeroLinux carries his imprint, and his contributions will forever be woven into its fabric. In a place like Lebanon, where Linux is a rarity, he stood out as a true gem, his knowledge far surpassing that of most people in our country.</p> <p>For over a year, our country has been engulfed in a conflict, one that escalated into tragic proportions in the last few weeks. It began as a high-tech war, with explosive devices disguised as everyday objects like pagers and walkie-talkies. The violence claimed many lives, and GamerKing was caught in the crossfire.</p> <p>Two weeks ago, his neighborhood was hit for the first time, and he suffered severe injuries, losing a significant amount of blood. From his hospital bed, he reached out to me, recounting the terrifying events. The details of his condition were harrowing, but he maintained his characteristic humor, and we joked about the situation, as we often did. It was a brief, bittersweet exchange, and when we said our goodbyes, I was reassured that he would recover. I had no idea it would be the last time we spoke.</p> <p> </p> <p>As the conflict worsened, bombings crept closer to both of us. I assumed he was resting and chose not to disturb him, unaware of the devastation that was to follow.</p> <p>Yesterday, as I write this, a massive bombing destroyed a six-building complex near GamerKing's location. Soon after, I received a message from his younger brother. At first, I believed it was GamerKing himself, and my immediate question was, \"Are you OK?\" But the reply came from his brother, who, after a moment of silence, shared the heartbreaking news: \"He told me that if anything happened to me, open Discord and tell Dark.\" I asked, trembling, \"Why? What happened?\" After what felt like an eternity, he delivered the words that shattered my world: \"He just left us.\"</p> <p>I still don\u2019t know what took him from us, whether it was his injuries or the bombing\u2014but the tragic truth remains: I have lost a dear friend, a colleague, and one of the brightest individuals I have ever had the privilege to know. The shock of his passing has yet to settle in, and I fear it never truly will.</p> <p>I will always remember his infectious energy, his humor, and his brilliance. He was the light of XeroLinux, and his absence will be deeply felt. Please join me in mourning the loss of a truly exceptional man.

Just keep that in mind.</p>","tags":["Linux","Cosmic","ArchLinux"]},{"location":"tech/cosmic-experience/#installation","title":"Installation","text":"<p>The Cosmic DE hype is real. I saw many reviews of it and was immediately pulled in and got the urge to install it n try it out for myself to see if it was being over-hyped/sensationalized or not. Simply because new things tend to be, it's the norm by now.</p> <p> </p> <p>Since I am an avid ArchLinux user, that's how I installed it. I did not use the Pop!_OS 24.04 LTS alpha ISO from &gt;&gt; Cosmic Downloads. So my views come from there. So I cannot compare.</p> <p>Anyway, before I talk about my experience using the DE, I would like to mention that, I did not use the ArchInstall profile to install it. Why you ask ? Simply because due to past experience, I learned the hard way not to fully trust them, they tend to be way too basic, missing a lot of essential packages. Don't get me wrong here, I am not saying that you shouldn't use them, far from it, if you just want basics doing everything else yourselves, feel free, but from a new user perspective who expect things to be more complete, please use Distros who do all that for you.</p> <p>Now on to the more detailed things I have done to install Cosmic. I first installed Arch Minimal using the ArchInstall script, meaning that I avoided the profiles, &amp; drivers sections completely, I always choose <code>Grub</code> as my bootloader, no swap since I have 32GB RAM, no Encryption either. And once in <code>chroot</code> I installed the DE the following way, knowing that, we can skip the use of <code>sudo</code> since we are still logged in as root...</p> <pre><code>pacman -Syy &amp;&amp; pacman -S cosmic linux-headers pacman-contrib xdg-user-dirs power-profiles-daemon wayland-protocols wayland-utils\n</code></pre> <p> </p> <p>Now, that needs a bit of explaining. In case you were wondering why so few packages, well, it's because cosmic is not a single one, it's a Group of packages or a meta-package as it is known as. That said, the reason I installed <code>linux-headers</code> is because for whatever reason, they were only included if and when you select drivers, same goes for the rest. Especially <code>xdg-user-dirs</code> without which no <code>Documents, Pictures, Videos...</code> folders will be created. Strange I know.</p> <p>What I also found weird, is the fact that <code>cosmic-greeter</code> service was not being enabled after install which was netting me a boot to <code>TTY</code> session. So I had to enable it while at the same time generating the <code>user-dirs</code> via...</p> <pre><code>systemctl enable cosmic-greeter.service &amp;&amp; xdg-user-dirs-update\n</code></pre> <p>Keep in mind that I am doing all this while still in <code>chroot</code> post-install. Once I was done with this I exited the live environment and rebooted crossing my fingers and hoping that all went well.</p>","tags":["Linux","Cosmic","ArchLinux"]},{"location":"tech/cosmic-experience/#experience","title":"Experience","text":"<p>Now on to what y'all came here for. All was good, well sorta, system rebooted into <code>Grub</code>, selected the OS and waitied... That's when I started to sweat a little, coz I was greeted with some <code>TTY dmsg</code> errors, flickering on and off. But after a few seconds I finally saw the Cosmic Greeter login screen, relief finally.</p> <p> </p> <p>I type my super secure password in n wait to see the Desktop. So far so good, or so I thought. More anxiety, as when I opened the Cosmic file manager, what I saw wasn't so great; icons were blacked out, and performance was shit. Being an nVidia user, I thought could be a driver issue since on first boot it uses the not so great <code>nouveau</code> ones. That's why my first reflex was to install them, so I did.</p> <p> </p> <p>After driver install was done, I rebooted and that's when my heart sank so deep I couldn't feel it anymore. Why ? How about a screen with so many errors in many colors complaining about <code>EGL drm</code> crap ? Yep wasn't showing the login screen anymore. OH NO! Failed already ?!?!?!?!?</p> <p>As it turns out I had forgotten to include the <code>nVidia drm kernel modules</code> lol. What am I talking about ? How to do that you ask ? Well, for me that's what I did, could be different for you I dunno.</p> <pre><code>sudo sed -i '/^MODULES=(/ s/)$/nvidia nvidia_modeset nvidia_uvm nvidia_drm)/' /etc/mkinitcpio.conf\nsudo systemctl enable nvidia-suspend.service nvidia-hibernate.service nvidia-resume.service nvidia-powerd.service\necho -e 'options nvidia NVreg_UsePageAttributeTable=1 NVreg_InitializeSystemMemoryAllocations=0 NVreg_DynamicPowerManagement=0x02' | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/nvidia.conf\necho -e 'options nvidia_drm modeset=1 fbdev=1' | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/nvidia.conf &amp;&amp; sudo mkinitcpio -P\n</code></pre> <p>After doing that, I rebooted again, heart in hand, fingers n toes crossed lol. Once rebooted, a sigh of relief, I could see the login screen again. So I login, and this time everything was great. Performance was so smooth n fast, sorta felt like XFCE. Fired up <code>top</code> to see memory usage, and to my surprise, it was only using 800mb RAM on fresh boot, that's almost 500MB less than KDE Plasma ! Nice !</p> <p>Now came the time to configure the DE. Since I had watched so many videos regarding it, I had a general idea of what to do. Since I have 2 Nics (1 for each ISP), first order of business was to disable one keeping the other active. So I hover mouse over the tray icon, click it then attempt to click to disable the one I do not need, only to see that I couldn't do shit. They seem to just be static indicators, at least for now. So arming myself with all that knowledge I fire up terminal and run <code>nmtui</code> and deactivate it from there making sure it doesn't automatically reconnect on login.</p> <p>Now on to the <code>System Settings</code>. I will not bore you with the details, suffice it to say, that's where the biggest Alpha cracks started to show up big time. User profile modification missing, Default Apps too. I mean I could barely do anything besides modify top panel, color scheme, applets, keyboard shortcuts (keybinds) and power profiles. There isn't even a way to enable autologin..</p> <p>That's when I began to get frustrated. I mean, how were users online saying they had a great experience when some of the most important things were missing ? I don't understand.</p> <p>Anyway, I then took my attention to the included apps. I open the launcher from the bottom dock and click a random one, didn't open, I thought was a mouse issue, so I click again, and again, only after a few clicks did app decide to finally run. WTF!! Angry, I open File Manager again n try to open a document, nothing... OMG!!! I mean not even default app to handle simple text document ? I mean Cosmic-Notes was there, just not handling documents...</p> <p>I try to right-click &gt; open with, only to see that part was missing as well, I mean it shows the open-with panel to the right, only nothing's there, it's empty. I kept repeating to myself \"It's Alpha Software, calm down Steve\".</p> <p>To relax a bit n make things easier, I installed my toolkit. Then when I tried launching it from the app menu thingy, no matter how many times I clicked it wouldn't launch. So I tried adding a keyboard shortcut for it, still nothing. I guess it's because it's a <code>CLI</code> and no default app set ? I dunno.</p> <p>Finally I decided to try out the thing that almost everyone's raving about, Tiling/Stacking. And yes, that part was amazing, worked out great no major deal breaking issues to speak of, just minor nit-picks. Nothing that wasn't mentioned in all them videos on the Tubes. Oh Great ! I thought to myself, sarcastically, coz the only thing that works best is the thing I will never use since I do not like that Tiling stuff.

Yep, there is no dumb question for them, they answer any and all to the best of their abilities.If you have any, feel free to join their Discord Server.</p> <ul> <li>File Browser</li> </ul> <p>As for the File Browser I use to share files between PCs, it's also has a creative name lol, just called FileBrowser, it serves one purpose, browsing files, with ability to upload &amp; download from/to any PC. That's it. It just works nothing else to say about that.</p> <ul> <li>Search Engine (Xoogle)</li> </ul> <p>Hehe, the only reason I called it Xoogle is coz it's Xero + Google, get it ? Anyway, this is using something called Whoogle, weird name I know, loogs damn ugly too. It's just a search engine that uses Google stripping it of all A.I crap and ads. Does its job I prefer it to any other coz I get the power of Google the way it was back in the day..</p> <ul> <li>Vaultwarden</li> </ul> <p>That's a 3<sup>rd</sup>-party Bitwarden server-as-a-container, endorsed by them so can be trusted called Vaultwarden. I use it coz I prefer to self-host private stuff like that. Where I have total control. I still keep a copy hosted by them. It's just in case they go under I am safe.</p> <ul> <li>ShareX</li> </ul> <p>This one is not for everyone. It uses Zipline. It's a File upload server with a twist. I exposed mine to the web, using it to share files with friends. Use it if you need something like that.</p> <ul> <li>My Comics</li> </ul> <p>I am a big fan of comic books, especially the ones from my childhood. This container uses Kavita. I love it simplicity.
