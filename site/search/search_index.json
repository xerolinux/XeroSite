This is where I will be posting my thoughts, feelings and some documentation for myself so I do not have to keep looking for them. Keep in mind that all the opinions, thoughts and feelings are my own. Also any documentation found here will be mostly modified to work for me. If I find something useful I will share it on the XeroLinux main site.</p> <p>I have always been captivated by the limitless potential of Linux, especially when it comes to mastering Arch Linux with its rich, customizable environment. From the very first moment of installing Arch and navigating the bare essentials, the thrill of uncovering the vast ecosystem of Linux has only intensified. It's a world where every command, every configuration file, and every script opens a new door to possibilities, and the joy of understanding how things work under the hood is unparalleled. This passion extends beyond just my personal journey; it's about fostering a community of like-minded individuals who are just as enthusiastic about diving into the depths of Linux. There's something incredibly fulfilling in sharing that \"Aha!\" moment with someone else, whether it's explaining the finer points of Bash scripting, demystifying a complex package manager, or finding the most efficient way to automate a tedious task. Every encounter with another learner is an opportunity to grow together, and I cherish these exchanges as a way to contribute to the broader Linux community.</p> <p> </p> <p>Documenting my learning journey has become an essential part of this experience. The importance of writing down processes, solutions, and insights cannot be overstated. It's not just a tool for personal growth; it's a powerful way to make life less stressful. There\u2019s a kind of magic in creating a reference that captures every little detail, every lesson learned, and every problem solved. Instead of wracking my brain trying to recall a solution from memory or scouring forums and wikis repeatedly for the same answers, I believe that a well-documented note can save time, reduce frustration, and make troubleshooting a far less daunting task. It becomes a reliable companion, ready to guide me whenever a familiar issue arises or a new challenge demands attention.</p> <p>I will be sharing some posts from here on my Fosstodon, so if you follow me there, you will see them. If not than what are you waiting for ? DO IT lol.

The Nonfree software is usually put in the actual source repo as binary blobs, or in the case of nVidia drivers, built using a system called DKMS and compiled into the kernel binary.</p> <p>Once the computer boots up, an init process is started (the default is <code>/sbin/init</code>, usually a symlink to your init system), which is <code>PID 1</code>. This is when userspace is initialized. Due to security concerns and whatnot, you are restricted from having a bit too much fun in userspace, so you need to ask the kernel to read files and allocate memory for you using syscalls.</p> <p>Anyways, init starts all the userspace stuff (it itself is run in userspace) and this keeps the system secure. Since Linux is monolithic, you can't just throw a malicious library into kernel space at runtime somehow, you have to compile it in. Anyways, Linux is a lot like Unix, with one notable difference being that Linux Is Not UniX. This means it uses the typical Unixy way of doing things like restricting access based on users and groups, being POSIX compliant, and not really caring about file extensions.</p> <p> </p>","tags":["Linux","Kernel","Packages"]},{"location":"docs/linux-explained/#distros-pkg-managers","title":"Distros &amp; PKG Managers","text":"<p>On Debian, you install packages with <code>apt</code>.

If your desktop environment comes with one, you can use theirs, as that one should be easier to use, while still providing the exact same functionality. You don't install programs by downloading them from the internet. If you have any questions, the Debian Wiki is pretty mid, but the Arch Wiki is amazing.</p> <p>Since Arch Linux is intended to be the most generic Linux distro ever, stuff written for Arch should also help with Debian, as long as the Arch package didn't get a bunch of major updates in the interim. There are also other ways of installing stuff, like Flatpak (sandboxed apps that \"just work\" on every distribution), and Snap (Ubuntu's sandboxed apps that they claim work on every distribution but have always been kind of sketchy). There are also AppImages which are basically like <code>.exe's</code> on Windows, but they're kind of a hassle to use compared to the others because you have to add executable permission to them, and then manually double click them.

A GUI file manager mounts flash drives somewhere in <code>/run</code> usually, because it's temporary. <code>/opt</code> is where random stuff goes, and <code>/var</code> is for variable storage like system logs. <code>/tmp</code> is self-explanatory. <code>/dev/null</code> is a bottomless pit, and <code>/dev/urandom</code> is a quick and easy IO-based random number generator.

It all started back in 2020, when I fell in love with KDE Plasma while using the now infamous [Manjaro]{:target=\"_blank\"} Distrobution. Yes, this is when I got hooked to Linux. Now don't get me wrong, I have since tried many DEs and WMs. But alas only KDE Plasma answered my needs.</p> <p>Since then I started getting the urge to build my own Distro my way. With everything I wanted out the box. At first it was hard, real hard. I couldn't find an easy way to do it. That's until I stumbled upon a project we all know and love called ArcoLinux.

So us Developers have all the right in the word to charge for our time. Read that again, charge for our TIME.</p> <p>Many of us are just contributers, contributing much of our free time, constantly giving without asking for anything in return.

Especially as a single individual.</p> <p>Now, I do agree with you when you say, we shouldn't force you to pay. That's why we use the Fundraising or Donation methods. While we do not force you, it would be great if you did. Would help both of us. You get a useful product while we are able to survive to give you more. A Win-Win scenario.

Now, let\u2019s dive in.</p> <p></p>","tags":["FOSS","Linux","Health","Struggles","Fundraising"]},{"location":"priv/real-foss-struggles/#my-frustration","title":"My Frustration","text":"<p>Recently, I\u2019ve been investing a lot of time and effort into my projects and contributing to FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) wherever possible. While I find this work rewarding, it\u2019s also been increasingly frustrating. Why? Let me explain.</p> <p>I spend countless hours working behind the scenes to make everyone\u2019s life easier. While there are a few of you who go above and beyond to support my work, and I am incredibly grateful for that, it\u2019s disheartening to see so little engagement overall. Feedback is crucial for improvement, and without issue reports or suggestions, it's challenging to know if I\u2019m making a real impact.</p>","tags":["FOSS","Linux","Health","Struggles","Fundraising"]},{"location":"priv/real-foss-struggles/#seeking-purpose","title":"Seeking Purpose","text":"<p>Initially, I embarked on this journey for fun and to learn new things. However, lately, I\u2019ve been questioning the purpose behind my efforts. It feels like I\u2019m stuck in a cycle of constant work with little to show for it. This isn\u2019t about blaming anyone; it\u2019s about seeking the motivation to keep going.</p>","tags":["FOSS","Linux","Health","Struggles","Fundraising"]},{"location":"priv/real-foss-struggles/#monetization-attempts","title":"Monetization Attempts","text":"<p>As my financial situation became more strained, I reluctantly turned to monetization. Many advised me to turn my passion into a viable source of income. So, I tried implementing a \"pay what you can\" model, hoping it would help sustain my work. However, this didn\u2019t go as planned.</p> <p>The FOSS community, known for its spirit of freedom, often struggles with the concept of financial support for free software. It\u2019s a complex issue, and while some have been supportive, overall, the response hasn\u2019t been enough to make a significant difference.</p>","tags":["FOSS","Linux","Health","Struggles","Fundraising"]},{"location":"priv/real-foss-struggles/#health-concerns","title":"Health Concerns","text":"<p>On top of these challenges, I have been dealing with significant health issues. Most notably, I have severe dental problems that require a full set of dentures. This isn\u2019t cheap, and without stable income, it\u2019s been impossible to address. These health issues have affected my confidence and my ability to engage publicly, adding another layer of difficulty to my situation.

Writing provides a creative outlet that isn\u2019t constrained by algorithms or view counts. I\u2019ll continue to work on my current projects, primarily for my own needs, but I might keep some future creations private until I can find a sustainable way to share them.</p> <p>My main priority now is finding a stable job that can support my financial needs.

Well, it took me so long to get monetization abilites, and when I did I was like, Nice!.</p> <p>But as time went by it became more and more difficult to come up with new ideas to keep it interesting.

Am not getting enough views, and my Live Streams are only getting 6 to 8 participants. Also the ideas, quality, and equipment not being available to continue. There's also the fact that there's no point of monetizing my content since YouTube and my Bank, the only one I can use are not talking to each other, without any way for me to fix that.

What I mean by that is, I will be publishing videos only when I feel the situation needs it, for example if I feel a guide I want to put out cannot be done in writing. Or when I need to show off a tool/script am working on. You get the idea.</p> <p>As to what day videos will be published, I will do it on a Wednesday whenever there is one. Also, do not worry about monthly Live Streams, they are here to stay. And when I get the chance, maybe bring back the XeroTalk seriles, where I sit down with various personalities in the Linux sphere and talk about various topics. Who knows.</p> <p>Bottom line is, my channel is nothing but a tool, not a way to monetize anymore. I hope I don't lose you as a subscriber because of this.

As you may already know, I\u2019m going through significant financial difficulties. Living in Lebanon, finding a job\u2014especially a remote one\u2014is extremely challenging, and the situation continues to worsen. I won\u2019t rehash the entire story here, but if you\u2019re not familiar, you can read more about it in this BlogPost.</p> <p>After giving it a lot of thought, I realized how much I truly enjoy Linux. With bills to pay and my distro\u2019s code still sitting on GitHub, it just makes sense. Many of you have been asking me to bring it back since I pulled the plug months ago, so why not use this opportunity to revive it\u2014and make it a way to sustain myself?</p> <p>Not to forget that I've been running it on my own this whole time, and maintaining the ISO was a blast. I've been itching to bring it back, especially since it was rapidly climbing the DistroWatch rankings as a popular distro.

For more details, check out the Release Post</p> <p>Now I know that some of you will go, \"but it's FOSS, you shouldn't charge for it.\" to which I will say the same thing I have been for a long time, the Free in Free Open Source does NOT mean free of charge, just means Freedom to fork the Source Code and do with it as you wish. I am just charging for my time.</p> <p>The distro will be continuously updated to ensure it works seamlessly and will stay alive as long as I have your support.

About 60% goes toward improving XeroLinux, covering costs like hosting, domains, and other essentials. The remaining 40% helps me with personal expenses like health, phone bills, etc., mainly because my other account hasn\u2019t been getting much support.

Yes a highly unlikly scenario I know. But the more I dug into the world of containerization the more intrigued I got. And that's when I discovered Docker containers, their countless uses. What blew me away mostly, is the fact that I can run cloud services like Immich for images and videos, which would allow me to sync my devices locally rather than with Apple iCloud or Google making me the sole owner of my data. So freeing OMG !!! No longer bound by those shackles...</p> <p>With that, I the deeper I went through this bottomless rabbit hole, the more truly useful containers I found. The idea that I can do whatever I wanted without having to deal with any 3<sup>rd</sup> party conglomerates made me fall in love more and more as time went by...</p>","tags":["Linux","Docker","Containers"]},{"location":"tech/docker-containers-a-love-story/#my-setup-so-far","title":"My setup so far","text":"<p>Yep, I know, you are eager to see what I have managed to pull off with everything I found. First, let me say this, I will not be the one guiding you on how to acheive MY setup, since your needs might differ from mine. Heck I am sure of it. Anyway, here's a screenshot, and below it I will link to the various containers I am using in case you find them useful.</p> <p> </p> <ul> <li>Homepage</li> </ul> <p>To start off, let me tell you what am using for the page you see in the image, it's simply called Homepage. Fitting name right ? I love its simplistic design, flexibility, and most of all what sold me on it is two-fold, the fact that everything is done via YAML configurations files, and that the community behind it are so damn friendly ! Yep, there is no dumb question for them, they answer any and all to the best of their abilities.If you have any, feel free to join their Discord Server.</p> <ul> <li>File Browser</li> </ul> <p>As for the File Browser I use to share files between PCs, it's also has a creative name lol, just called FileBrowser, it serves one purpose, browsing files, with ability to upload &amp; download from/to any PC. That's it. It just works nothing else to say about that.</p> <ul> <li>Search Engine (Xoogle)</li> </ul> <p>Hehe, the only reason I called it Xoogle is coz it's Xero + Google, get it ? Anyway, this is using something called Whoogle, weird name I know, loogs damn ugly too. It's just a search engine that uses Google stripping it of all A.I crap and ads. Does its job I prefer it to any other coz I get the power of Google the way it was back in the day..</p> <ul> <li>Vaultwarden</li> </ul> <p>That's a 3<sup>rd</sup>-party Bitwarden server-as-a-container, endorsed by them so can be trusted called Vaultwarden. I use it coz I prefer to self-host private stuff like that. Where I have total control. I still keep a copy hosted by them. It's just in case they go under I am safe.</p> <ul> <li>ShareX</li> </ul> <p>This one is not for everyone. It uses Zipline. It's a File upload server with a twist. I exposed mine to the web, using it to share files with friends. Use it if you need something like that.</p> <ul> <li>My Comics</li> </ul> <p>I am a big fan of comic books, especially the ones from my childhood. This container uses Kavita. I love it simplicity. I am also proud to say that I currently sponsor their work coz devs are very friendly so is this tool. It works for my needs, I hope it does for you in case you choose to use it. If you have any, feel free to join their Discord Server.</p> <ul> <li>Audiobookshelf</li> </ul> <p>I guess I do not need to explain that one. It's just a docker container for Audiobookshelf. In case you have some Audio books or podcasts. Have fun.</p> <ul> <li>FreshRSS</li> </ul> <p>That too doesn't need an introduction, just that it's the feed agregator I chose to use. Called FreshRSS. It's simple to use, looks good enough, and supports tons of plugins to extend it above and beyond.</p> <ul> <li>Immich</li> </ul> <p>Now, this is one of the big ones, Immich is an amazing image cloud like service. Allowing you to move away from Apple and Google. I love that as I said at the beginning of this long post. They even have companion apps for both Android and iOS which makes it even more amazing. Now we can sync out photos and videos between devices.
