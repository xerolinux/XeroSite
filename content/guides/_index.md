# Guides Section

In this section I will be posting the various **Linux** guides. Before you ask, they are primarily added here for my own usage, where I will be modifying them to work for me. However, feel free to use them and tweak them to work for you. But please all that's required from you is that you not to ask me for help. 

I will try to categorize them by Distro / General. Click on relevant one below.<br/><br/>

# Share your guides

If you have ones that might be useful to myself as well as others, please do not hesitate to share them with me, and I will do my best to post on here. For now only ones that belong to **Arch**, **General Linux** or **NixOS**. I currently have none for **NixOS** as am still learning.

To suggest useful guides, kindly do so via [**Discord**](https://discord.xerolinux.xyz) on the **Linux** channel...

Cheers y'all üçª
