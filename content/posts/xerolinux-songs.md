# Introduction

I have recently discovered an awesome **A.I Music Generation** service called [**Suno**](https://suno.com). 

It's so amazing I decided to fork up the $8/month to get access to the *Pro* version that generates more realistic vocals and has tons of more features, like accuracy control, custom audio and lyrics and so much more. It will blow your mind !!!

I had so much fun with it I decided to create songs for **XeroLinux** and **Linux**. Below you will find a few of them embedded...

# XeroLinux Songs

Below are 2 of the songs I created using this service. This one is **Heavy Metal**.

And this one is **PsyTrance**

# Linux Songs

I also made a **Linux** song. It's **Melodic Rock**...

# Conclusion

Just keep in mind that I do not recommend you use this service to make music for your videos or to use in professional projects since licensing is questionable as it always is with anything generated using **A.I** tools. Be very careful. I heard that some people tried to make money with it only to be caught and their content taken down. Better safe than sorry as I always say.

Thanks for Listening. ‚ù§Ô∏èüî•üôè
