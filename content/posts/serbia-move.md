# The Move  

So, I recently decided to *move* to **Serbia** — well, “move” might be a bit of an overstatement since it’s only temporary. The idea is to focus on my health, which hasn’t exactly been at its best lately. Living here is also a lot more affordable than back home in **Lebanon**, which definitely helps since my only income at the moment comes from **XeroLinux**. Every little bit counts until I find a more stable source of income.  

The move itself went surprisingly smoothly. The only tough part was a long 7-hour layover in **Athens**. My cousin was with me, and we walked so much that my legs nearly gave out, but once I finally landed, got to the apartment, and crashed for a solid 12 hours, things started falling into place. 

Here’s a little breakdown of what I’ve been dealing with and how I’m handling it all.

# ADHD & Mental Health  

My ADHD has been acting up lately, probably because I haven’t been managing it properly. On top of that, I recently found out I also have something called [**Functional Freeze**](https://www.verywellmind.com/functional-freeze-11809716). It explains so much. Basically, it’s when your brain just refuses to let you do even the simplest things, making them feel like climbing a mountain barefoot. 

I finally decided to see a therapist, who’s helping me through it and recommended some medication along with monthly sessions. It’s a work in progress, but at least I’m getting the help I need. 

As for my anxiety and depression — those are still hanging around, but I’ll deal with them once the ADHD is under better control. One step at a time.

# Physical Health & Other Stuff  

On the physical side of things, I had a rough time with [**Hemorrhoids**](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hemorrhoids/symptoms-causes/syc-20360268) (fun times, right?). Thankfully, that’s now under control thanks to meds and a change in habits — turns out, going overboard on spicy food wasn’t doing me any favors.  

Then there’s the muscle situation. My physical therapist basically told me my muscles are “half asleep.” I’ve been way too sedentary, sitting at my desk all day. So now I’m taking 3km walks every other day (when the weather allows) and planning to join a 12-session program to strengthen my back and core, once my budget allows it.  

But hey, nothing major’s wrong. I’m not dying or anything like that, which is always good news, right? 😅

# YouTube Plans  

I brought along my mic, webcam, and MiniPC to maybe get back into **YouTube** content… but I didn’t realize how much I’d miss my 3-monitor setup! Working with just one feels like trying to juggle blindfolded. Without a [**StreamDeck**](https://www.elgato.com/us/en/p/stream-deck), managing **OBS-Studio** scenes and effects on a single screen is a pain.  

I know there are phone apps that try to replace the **StreamDeck**, but let’s just say they’re *not quite there yet*. So I’ve decided to put **YouTube** on hold (again) until I’m back home after **Christmas**. I’ve got a few exciting announcements planned for when that happens, can’t wait to share more soon.

Honestly, I don’t know how some of you manage with just one monitor… total respect.

# Wrapping It Up  

Long story short, I’ve got to move more, take better care of my brain, and keep working on **XeroLinux** one step at a time. Thankfully, nothing too serious is standing in my way.

All I ask is for a little patience while I get my life and health back on track. I’ll still be around and available if you need me, I just need to pace myself.  

I’ve got plenty of plans for **XeroLinux**, and I’m excited for what’s ahead. It’ll just take some time, care, and a slower pace to make it all happen without burning out again.  


Thanks for Reading. ❤️🔥🙏
