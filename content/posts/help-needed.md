# The Challenge

Building a Linux distribution has been a deeply rewarding project, but I’ve recently hit a significant obstacle. Despite investing considerable time and effort, my knowledge and skills have reached their limit. There are many improvements I want to make, yet the technical complexity and absence of clear, comprehensive guides on how to build and maintain a distro make progress difficult. Unlike other software projects, the documentation is fragmented and incomplete, leaving much to be figured out individually.

# The Reality

I’m not a professional developer, and learning to navigate the intricate systems behind a Linux distribution has proven much harder than I anticipated. The steep learning curve and complexity of tasks such as kernel customization, package management, and system integration are overwhelming. This situation isn’t about lacking motivation or dedication — it’s a practical recognition of my current capabilities in a very technical domain.

# The Call for Help

To move forward, the project desperately needs new contributors. Collaboration is crucial to overcoming these challenges and accelerating development. Whether you’re experienced with Linux, coding, documentation, or community support, your contribution matters. If interested, please reach out to me on Discord, or in the comments below. Together, we can make the Distro stronger and expand its potential.

# Moving Forward

While the project started as a solo effort, its future depends on building a community. By pooling our skills and resources, what seemed impossible alone can become achievable. This is an open invitation to join in and help shape something meaningful in the open-source world. Let’s work together to take this project to the next level.
