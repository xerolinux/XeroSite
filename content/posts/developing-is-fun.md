# Am I a Developer ?

Lol, yeah, I know—it's a question I get a lot. But in my humble opinion, no, I am not. Far from it. I'm just a guy who, at most, messes with code—specifically **Bash**. I take what I understand, put it together in a way that makes sense (to me at least), and hope it works. That's all I do.

And if it does work, I'm happy and share the result with the **FOSS** community.

# It's fun until...

Doing this is super fun and fulfilling—until I hit a brick wall, stop getting new ideas, or can't find a solution to what I'm trying to accomplish. Yes, it's super frustrating.

Now, I know I can reach out to the **FOSS** community for help. However, not all of it is sunshine and roses. I try, but I often get more frustrated with the differences of opinion out there. No matter how much I try to satisfy some requests, I can't do it for everyone.

Sometimes, I run into some elitists who think their opinion is the only one that matters. I always make the mistake of replying to them when it's better to ignore them. Yes, those types of people exist everywhere—not just in **FOSS**. But alas, that's where we feel it the most, especially when we try to monetize our work. But I already discussed that in another post.

Nevertheless, once a project is complete, the feeling of accomplishment is so rewarding, lol.

# Sharing is caring

This is the part where I say: please, don't keep your work to yourself. Share it with the community—who knows, maybe you'll find someone who can help take your project to another level.

I used to keep stuff to myself until I began sharing. That's when everything took off, and I was able to help others. If it's not a project, maybe it's the knowledge you've gained. Share it by helping others when and where you can.

"Sharing is caring," as the saying goes. Anyway, I hope this post was a good read. Enjoy! ;)
