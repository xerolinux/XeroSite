# Information

[**DistroWatch**](https://distrowatch.com/) is basically your go-to website if you're into **Linux** or other open-source Unix-like operating systems. It’s been around since 2001 and keeps a huge, up-to-date database of hundreds of Linux distributions plus some BSDs and other niche OSes. You can check out detailed info, compare them, see their release histories, read user reviews, and snag official download links all in one place.

They also have weekly news updates and summary articles to keep you in the loop with the latest happenings in the Linux world. Plus, there’s a friendly community vibe with forums and guides for beginners and pros alike. Overall, it’s like a one-stop shop for exploring and staying ahead in the open-source OS game.

# The Good, The Bad & The Ugly

Starting with the **Good**—DistroWatch is basically the reason a lot of distros get noticed at all. Without it, many would just be stuck in obscurity with hardly anyone hearing about them. For example, I credit some of the buzz around **XeroLinux** to this site. Plus, I like how they keep track of each distro’s release history so users can easily follow along with updates and changes.

Now for the **Bad**—there’s a downside. The site isn’t really well-moderated. That means anyone can post whatever, true or not, and it just stays there. The admins don’t seem to verify or control what’s being said about distros. So you end up with stuff floating around that might be misleading or flat out wrong. Not cool, in my opinion.

And finally, the **Ugly**—which is the main reason I’m venting here. **XeroLinux** has been listed on DistroWatch since 2022 and was gradually gaining traction. Then, when I had to step away due to burnout, they marked it as **Discontinued**. *No longer is, check update below*.

At first, I was like, fine, no big deal. But the distro’s been back in action nearly a year now, and despite my repeated **emails**, **Mastodon** messages, and even supporting them on **Patreon** asking to update the status, nothing’s changed. Total radio silence. At this point, I’m convinced it’s all managed by some kind of **A.I** that doesn’t care about the hard work behind projects. It’s super frustrating and disrespectful. I rely on that exposure, yet they just ignore me. What kind of site does that? A bad one.

## Situation Update

Since publishing this post, situation has been resolved. **XeroLinux** has been re-instated, links updated, and slowly getting back on the ladder. It was all thanks to one person from the **DistroWatch** team. I dunno if I should mention his name, but thanks nevertheless. 

I chose not to delete the post simply because parts of it remain to be true as some of my fellow Distro maintainers have told me recently and in the past. I am just updating you on recent events. Anyway if you want to help us climb the *Popularity Ladder* much faster and/or write a short review you can do so [**Over Here**](https://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=xero).

But please do not use this site as the defacto place for *Popularity Measure*. That site just lists Distros by download and view counts not by how many users actually use it. Nobody knows if reviewers are actually using the distro they reviewed or not, or how long they used it for before revieweing it.

Finally be mindful of the information posted about each and every distro, some of it might be accurate, some of it not so much. Only by testing the distro yourself will you know the truth.

Drop your thoughts about this mess in the comments. I’d love to hear what you think.

Thanks for reading ❤️‍🔥🙏
