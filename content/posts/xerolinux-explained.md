## Introduction

For the past few months I‚Äôve been asked these questions time and time again. What exactly is **XeroLinux** and Why is it shoved behind a so-called donation wall? Well, in this post I will be explaining it once and for all in an attempt to clarify everything.

So sit tight and read-on‚Ä¶

# XeroLinux & Goal

**XeroLinux** is an *Arch-Based* Linux Distribution that I created primarily for myself making it easier for me to install using [**Calamares**](https://calamares.io). As for the D.E of choice, well, it's [**KDE Plasma**](https://kde.org) of course. In the beginning I was too ambitious and included way too much bloat *Garuda Style*, which was really bad. Below is a video of the very 1st release of **XeroLinux** see how bad it was.

As time went on however, I kept optimizing it until I got myself a solid base I can build on. See, I did not want to have every piece of software I used available to me out of the box, just the settings, since those take much longer to set up. And by settings I mean system optimizations as well as "*Ricing*". Why?, Because what I need changes every week/month and it would grow the ISO to unmanageable sizes. 

‚ÄúWhat about drivers?‚Äù The same reasoning, my hardware changes from time to time, so having ones that work for my system today might not work in a week or month. That's why I decided to only have basic (*Kernel*) drivers out of the box with the ability to install extra ones later on. 

Once I started sharing the ISO around with my close friends, they loved it so much for its stability, ease of installation, and bloat-free'ness that they suggested I turn it into a full-on Distro available to everyone. I was reluctant to agree, because by making it public would mean I am  responsible for providing support for it. It took time but got there eventually.

# Rise & Fall

The Distro rose to become more popular than I had ever imagined, beating [**EndeavourOS**](https://endeavouros.com) at one point on [**DistroWatch**](https://distrowatch.com) as long as it was *Free* and available that is.. Yes, my fellow readers, that was great and all but with every rise comes a hard fall. What I mean by that is, as soon as I put a price on it, it took a turn for the worse. 

Adding [**Gnome**](https://www.gnome.org) to the family by popular request made things a just a bit more difficult...

# Donation-Wall

As my responsibility towards my users grew, and new versions were added, so did the cost of working on the project. Being a one-man project from a 3rd-world country like **Lebanon**, the situation is bleak to say the least. With jobs being scarce, I couldn't keep up financially speaking. That's why I took a short break to re-evaluate things. I tried turning the project into a *post-install script* for *Vanilla Arch* which worked at first, but then people started requesting I bring Distro back to life, which I did eventually.

I had to change something in order for it to survive. That's when I found [**ArchCraft**](https://archcraft.io/premium.html), an amazing *Arch-Based* Distro who was charging for so called *Premium Versions* of his Distro, which gave me the idea of putting **XeroLinux** behind a *Donation Wall*. With this model you donate for my time, not the ISO. The code is, and forever will be available free of charge for you to fork and do with it as you please on [**Github**](https://github.com/XeroLinuxDev/xero-build).

Now before you say it, I will, "*But it's not the same !*". I do agree that it's not the same thing, but hear me out. While he offers *Free* versions for everyone to test the waters, in reality it's a great **Marketing Strategy** on his part. See, every product has a sort of free *Demo* which is used as a so called *Hook*. It's called a *Hook* simply because it's used to hook you into buying the full, or a more *premium* version of said product. 

**XeroLinux** doesn't use the same strategy, simply because it's too risky, it does offer other ways to achieve similar, but not exact, results via various [**Scripts**](https://xerolinux.xyz/scripts/) I make available totally for free. What do I mean by *Too Risky* you ask ? Lemme explain that.

If I offered a free version of the Distro, people would stick to it and avoid any other paid version. There's no way to create a *limited* version either. I have been part of the Linux community long enough to know that most people like to think that the word *Free* in the *Free Open Source* model means free beer which is a huge misconception. It just means *Freedom* to do with as you please. 

That's why almost no one pays for such projects and we get attacked for charging for them. This has to stop or else projects will continue to fade away!

# Wrap-Up

Let's wrap this up shall we? I would like to close this post by saying, even though **XeroLinux** does not offer much in the way of features like [**CachyOS**](https://cachyos.org) and others out there, that wasn't the aim of this distro. If you do not agree with the project's vision, please do not hate, just move on and use whatever works for you. No judgement.

Anyway, if and when I am more financially stable I promise you that there will no longer be a price associated with this project, it will be free for everyone to enjoy. Until then however, please do understand that I am currently struggling financially with this being my only source of income. I have no other means at my disposal. 

Lastly I would like to share my appreciation to every person out there who has and is still supporting the project financially or via time investments. You are making it possible for me to keep going! If you haven't yet gotten yourself a copy or don't know how to support the **XeroLinux** project, here are some links.

Also please let me know your thoughts in the comments below, tell me if you agree or disagree with the reasoning behind my actions. It's ok if you don't agree, I will not judge you, it's a judgement-free zone over here.

Thanks for reading. ‚ù§Ô∏èüî•üôè
