# Introduction

Many people ask for a *free* version of **XeroLinux** so they can try it before deciding to donate. While I completely understand the wish to test it first, I‚Äôm unable to offer a free version. The reason is that if I did, many might use it forever without supporting the project.

But don‚Äôt worry! There is still a way to get a feel for what this distro offers before you decide to commit. It takes a little more effort, but it‚Äôs simple to follow.

Grab a seat and let‚Äôs dive in‚Ä¶

# XeroLinux D.E Script

If you want to experience what **XeroLinux** is all about, I‚Äôve got you covered! I‚Äôve created a special script that lets you install a *pure vanilla* version of **KDE Plasma**, **Gnome**, **XFCE**, **Hyprland**, or even **Cosmic** (Alpha), completely free.

Just follow the simple guide on the [**XeroWiki**](https://wiki.xerolinux.xyz/script/). Currently, we offer **KDE Plasma** and **Gnome** as our main options, so start with either one to get the real **XeroLinux** feel!<br /><br />

Once you have your preferred desktop environment installed, simply launch the [**Toolkit**](https://wiki.xerolinux.xyz/xlapit/). You can find it in the app menu or just open a terminal and type `clear && xero-cli`.

Then choose option `4` labeled `Customization`. If you picked **KDE Plasma**, select `x. XeroLinux's Layan Rice (Vanilla KDE)`. If you chose **Gnome**, go for `z. Apply XeroLinux Gnome Settings (Vanilla Gnome)`.

Sit back and watch the magic happen, then reboot to enjoy the experience!<br /><br />

That‚Äôs it, really! You won‚Äôt be getting *everything* the distro offers, just a taste. Think of the *Script + Toolkit* as a way to get a demo of what **XeroLinux** has in store for you.

# Benefits

The great thing about all this is that you‚Äôll learn how to install **Arch Linux** and get a real feel for what you‚Äôll get if you decide to donate to the project.

Just keep in mind that the *Script + Toolkit* won‚Äôt give you *exactly* what the ISOs offer. It‚Äôs pretty close, but the ISOs come with a lot more out of the box, they are *not* just a rice. So, some things will still need to be done manually by you.

Remember that and enjoy exploring!

# Wrap-Up

Just so you know, this whole experience is absolutely free with no strings attached. Think of it as your exclusive sneak peek at what **XeroLinux** has to offer! You get to dive in, try out its unique features, and get a genuine taste of its power and style without spending a dime.

If you find yourself loving the flexibility, the thoughtful design, and the freedom it brings, consider taking the next step. Your donation does more than cover costs; it fuels future updates, new features, and the extra layer of polish that makes [**XeroLinux**](https://xerolinux.xyz) stand out.

Supporting the project keeps it alive and growing, so you and the community enjoy the best experience possible.
