# Introduction

I’ve been on **iOS** for so long that at this point I’m pretty sure Apple has my neurological patterns stored somewhere in **iCloud**. My iPhone 11 has been a loyal soldier, survived drops, travel, stress, boredom scrolling, and maybe a few emotional support duties. After nearly six years, it still looks brand-new… but the battery? Yeah, it’s at **76%**. Basically it’s the tech equivalent of: “Grandpa needs to sit down for a moment.”

Add the fact that Apple is dropping support for it next major update, and suddenly my phone feels like it’s standing outside the club while the new models walk in with VIP passes.

I knew it was time to upgrade. But this time, thanks to life being life, I didn’t have the financial comfort to stay with **Apple**. So… **Android** it is. Yes, I’m moving to the **Dark Side**.Last time I used **Android**, things were chaotic, laggy, and looked like a UI designer was drunk at 3AM. But times change, right? Right…?

# The Process

Now, as we all know, when it comes to **Android** the landscape is huge ! Eventhough I limited myself to upper mid-range phones, that doesn't narrow it down a lot. So I had to keep creating check boxes to tick. The more I did the lesser choice I had. 

What matters most to me is not to get a phone from a lesser known manufacturer, since the lesser known it is the worse support gets. I needed a phone from a reputable OEM, with a promise of at least 4 years of **MAJOR** OS updates, nevermind security ones. Also one that has near flagship specs so it lasts for that long without it slowing down too much.

# The Choice

If you’ve ever tried choosing an **Android** phone, you know the experience: the more you look, the more confused you get. The “options” page becomes a maze, and before you know it, you’re comparing devices that only exist in Japan for six weeks a year. Meanwhile on iOS it’s like: small, medium, large. Done.

I tried to be logical. I kept adding requirements, good support, not some random brand nobody’s heard of, something that will last a few years without turning into a brick. And every time I added a requirement, the list of possible phones shrank like it owed me money.

Eventually I ended up with three brands circling my brain: **Google**, **Samsung**, and **OnePlus**.

And that’s when I entered the YouTube Rabbit Hole of Doom — review after review, comparison after comparison, until I started recognizing tech reviewers by the shape of their thumbnails.

- **Google Pixel**

The [**Google Pixel 9a**](https://www.gsmarena.com/google_pixel_9a-13478.php) really tempted me. Seven years of updates? [**GrapheneOS**](https://grapheneos.org) support? Clean software? Yes, please. But then reality slapped me, it’s the same size as my **iPhone 11**. I’ve been staring at the same-sized screen for years, I deserve more. I want a phone that feels like a small billboard, not a sticky note.

- **Samsung**

Samsung was the next contestant. Everyone recommends Samsung like it’s some sacred rule of the internet. And at first glance, the [**Galaxy A56**](https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_galaxy_a56-13603.php) sounded great. Until I remembered Samsung loves stuffing apps into their phones like they’re packing for a month-long holiday. Duplicate apps everywhere, performance just “okay,” and custom ROM support? Nonexistent. Basically it felt like buying a phone that comes pre-loaded with chores.

- **OnePlus**

And then came **OnePlus**. I’ve owned a OnePlus before, the legendary [**OnePlus 6t](https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_6t-9350.php), from the era before they fully merged into the **OPPO** hive mind, so at least the name felt familiar. The more I watched reviews, the more it started feeling like the middle ground I needed. Not perfect, not awful, not overpriced. Just… comfortable.

So that’s how I ended up picking the [**OnePlus Nord 5**](https://www.gsmarena.com/oneplus_nord_5_5g-13992.php). No dramatic music or fireworks, just relief that the search was over.

For around **350 euros**, I got something that doesn’t feel cheap, doesn’t feel outdated, and doesn’t feel like it’s going to scream for mercy in two years. With its big display, fast chip, and enough storage to hold every meme the internet throws at me, it felt like the least headache-inducing choice.

Do I trust **OnePlus** to keep their promises about four major OS updates and six years of security patches? Look… let’s just say I’m optimistic. And if I’m wrong, you’ll hear me complaining about it loudly in six months.

# Conclusion

Trying to choose an upper mid-range **Android** phone is honestly wild. One minute you think you’ve found “the one,” the next minute you find a model that only exists in **Lithuania** with twice the specs for half the price. It’s exhausting. This is why **iPhones** were easy: three models and done. No thinking required. Just if wallet will hurt n complain or not.

I’m still a bit sad to leave **iOS**, it’s familiar, consistent, and predictable. But at the same time, there’s something fun about rediscovering **Android** with fresh eyes. Maybe I’ll love it. Maybe I’ll regret everything. That’s part of the adventure.

I’ll post an update six months into owning the **Nord 5**, assuming I haven’t rage-thrown it into the sea or sold it to buy **Lebanese** snacks.

Until then, feel free to check out the device comparison I used on [**GSM-Arene**](https://www.gsmarena.com/compare.php3?idPhone1=13992&idPhone2=13478&idPhone3=13603)

Thanks for reading ❤️🔥🙏  
And may your battery health always stay above 80%.
