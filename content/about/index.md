My nameâ€™s **Steve**, A.K.A **TechXero/DarkXero**, and I am a 45 year old Tech fanatic from **Lebanon**. I love technology, mainly Computer Hardware/Software, smartphones, and **Linux**.

I am an avid **iOS** user when it comes to smartphones. I did use **Android** for 5 years, was happy on it for a while, I moved to **iOS** and have been a happy man ever since. However, itâ€™s not to say that I will stick with it for good, who knows what the future holds? I might go back to **Android**.. I use both in parallel now see where I will landâ€¦

Other than that, I do freelance as a **Technical Support specialist** from time to time. I have landed a Job at **Apple** in 2019, in **Ireland**. But it didnâ€™t last long unfortunately, canâ€™t go into detail as to why, but at least I can say that I have worked for that company LoLâ€¦ I am currently unemployed, but itâ€™s OK. I do get by.<br /><br />

Cheers y'all ðŸ˜€
