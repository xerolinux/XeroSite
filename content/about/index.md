# A short biography

Well, where should I start ? My nameâ€™s **Steve**, A.K.A **TechXero/DarkXero**, and I am a 45 year old Tech fanatic from **Lebanon**. I love technology, mainly Computer Hardware/Software, smartphones, and some web-design. I also love many music genres, like all types of Electronic mostly anything with hard bass, classic 80â€™s, Heavy Metal, Country, among others.<br /><br />

Films too, especially Art Films by famous Directors like **Lars Von Trier**, **Tarkovsky**, **Kubrick**, **Francis Ford Copolla**, **George Lucas** and others.<br /><br />

Now, donâ€™t get me wrong, I do like some of the commercial movies coming out today, but not all. These days they tend to do remakes rather than come up with new stuffâ€¦<br /><br />

I am an avid **iOS** user when it comes to smartphones. I did use **Android** for 5 years, was happy on it for a while, I moved to **iOS** and have been a happy man ever since.
However, itâ€™s not to say that I will stick with it for good, who knows what the future holds? I might go back to **Android**.. I use both in parallel now see where I will landâ€¦

All this is to say that, in essence, I am a *Multi-User*, as in, I donâ€™t stick to one Platform, I like to dabble in all of them. I currently use **iOS** and **Android** when it comes to Smartphones. **macOS**, **Windows** and **Linux** when it comes to *Desktop Operating Systems*. I currently maintain my very own *ArchLinux Toolkik/Distro* **[XeroLinux](https://xerolinux.xyz)**.

Other than that, I do freelance as a **Technical Support specialist** from time to time. I have landed a Job at **Apple** in 2019, in **Ireland**. But it didnâ€™t last long unfortunately, canâ€™t go into detail as to why, but at least I can say that I have worked for that company LoLâ€¦ I am currently unemployed, but itâ€™s OK. I do get by.

Cheers y'all ðŸ˜€
